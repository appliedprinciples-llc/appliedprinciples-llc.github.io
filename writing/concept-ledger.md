Below is the **fully integrated Concept Ledger**, incorporating:

* All concepts present in the working paper
* Clear **CORE vs SUPPORTING** classification
* A distinct section for **Imported Supporting Concepts (Non-ICT)** with citations
* No new theory, no invented language, no expansion beyond what already exists in your documents
* Explicit architectural intent (this is a **governance artifact**, not prose)

This is the version you keep **private and canonical**.

# Interpretive Conditions Theory

## Concept Ledger (Canonical, Private)

**Purpose of this document**
This ledger is the authoritative semantic contract for Interpretive Conditions Theory (ICT).
It governs meaning across all public, practitioner, and academic artifacts.

* If a claim is **not represented here**, it is **not yet part of the theory**
* Public explanations may simplify language, but **may not alter meaning**
* Academic arguments may extend or defend concepts, but **may not redefine them without ledger revision**

---

## CONCEPT CLASSIFICATION

* **CORE concepts** define the identity and causal logic of ICT
* **SUPPORTING concepts (ICT-owned)** refine, operationalize, or extend the core
* **IMPORTED supporting concepts** are explicitly borrowed, bounded, and non-owned

---

# CORE CONCEPTS (ICT-OWNED)

These concepts are **identity-defining**.
Removing or collapsing any of them dissolves the theory.

---

## Interpretive Conditions Theory (ICT)

**Canonical Definition**
An interpretive-institutional theory of organizing that explains persistent patterns of behavior as responses to conditions people interpret as legitimate, risky, or worthwhile over time, with patterns persisting only through continuous coordinated reenactment.

**Core Claim**
Persistence in human systems arises from learned interpretation of conditions, not from plans, attitudes, or enforcement alone.

**Non-Claims**

* Not predictive
* Not prescriptive
* Not a theory of motivation or personality
* Not a field-level diffusion theory

---

## Conditions

**Canonical Definition**
External, observable features of the environment that people encounter and interpret when deciding how to act. Conditions shape meaning often implicitly and sometimes prior to explicit deliberation. Conditions function recursively as both input and output.

**Key Properties**

* External and observable
* Include norms, rules, tools, feedback, and constraints
* May constrain action directly (capacity, authority, tools) or indirectly through interpretation

---

## Legitimacy

**Canonical Definition**
The shared sense of what actions are acceptable, safe, or worth the effort within a system, shaping what people feel able to do regardless of formal permission.

**Key Properties**

* Learned through experience, not declared
* Inferred from consequences, not intent
* Operates implicitly

**States of Legitimacy**

* Contested
* Routine
* Taken-for-granted

**Ontological Status**

* Phenomenological
* Relational
* Institutional

---

## Interpretation

**Canonical Definition**
The sensemaking process through which individuals assess cues and determine what actions make sense within the system.

**Key Properties**

* Often implicit
* Socially situated
* Precedes deliberate choice

---

## Response

**Canonical Definition**
The actions people take—or avoid—based on their interpretation of legitimacy and risk.

**Response Types**

* Reproduction
* Variation
* Violation/testing
* Coordinated change

---

## Agency

**Canonical Definition**
The capacity of people to choose how they respond to conditions, even when options are constrained.

**Core Role**
Agency is the mechanism through which structures are reproduced or changed.

---

## Structures (as Continuous Enactment)

**Canonical Definition**
Patterns continuously recreated through coordinated action. Structures exist only in ongoing enactment and dissolve when reproduction stops.

**Key Clarification**
Structures are not charts, policies, or stored entities.

---

## Distributed / Structural Memory

**Canonical Definition**
What people have collectively learned, through overlapping experiences, about what responses are legitimate, safe, or worthwhile.

**Key Properties**

* Distributed across individuals
* Enacted, not stored
* Guides behavior without enforcement

---

## Coordination–Legitimacy Distinction

**Canonical Definition**
A conceptual distinction between behavioral convergence driven by coordination dependencies and interpretive convergence driven by legitimacy.

**Core Insight**
Behavioral stability does not imply legitimacy convergence.

---

## Contested Equilibrium

**Canonical Definition**
A stable state in which practices are routinely enacted (coordination has tipped) while legitimacy remains persistently contested.

**Core Claim**
Practices can become structurally remembered as routines of compliance before—and even without—becoming legitimate as shared meaning.

---

# CORE (OPERATIONAL) CONCEPTS

These concepts operationalize the core logic and are required for explanation, diagnosis, and empirical work.

---

## Cues

**Definition**
Observable signals drawn from conditions that indicate what actions are legitimate, risky, or worthwhile.

**Key Property**
Cues gain force through cross-domain consistency.

---

## Domains of Influence

**Definition**
Analytically distinct categories of environmental and social cues through which legitimacy is signaled and learned.

### Structural / Environmental Domains

* Data & Feedback
* Tools & Processes
* Capacity
* Skills & Knowledge
* Motivation & Values

### Collective Domain

* Norms & Expectations

---

## Coordination Tipping Point

**Definition**
The threshold at which a practice becomes the cheapest or easiest way to coordinate work, independent of legitimacy.

---

## Legitimacy Tipping Point

**Definition**
The threshold at which a practice becomes taken-for-granted as sensible and appropriate.

---

## Change

**Definition**
A shift in conditions—especially legitimacy cues across domains—combined with coordinated enactment of new responses that, through repetition, form new distributed memory.

---

# SUPPORTING CONCEPTS (ICT-OWNED)

These concepts refine mechanisms and implications but are not identity-defining.

---

## Structural Mechanism

**Definition**
How domains enable or constrain action through allocation of tools, resources, authority, and time.

---

## Signaling Mechanism

**Definition**
How domains reveal priorities and legitimacy through investment, enforcement, attention, and tolerance.

---

## Cognitive Mechanism

**Definition**
How domains shape what is thinkable by providing language, categories, and mental models.

---

## Cue-Based Learning

**Definition**
Learning that occurs through interpretation of environmental cues about legitimacy prior to action.

---

## Outcome-Based Learning

**Definition**
Learning that occurs through trial, feedback, and observed outcomes.

---

## Domain Alignment

**Definition**
The degree to which cues across domains consistently signal the same legitimacy judgment.

---

## Coordination Stability

**Definition**
The durability of behavioral enactment produced by coordination dependencies or enforcement, independent of legitimacy.

---

## Stewardship of Conditions

**Definition**
The capacity of some actors to shape the conditions others respond to, without being able to impose legitimacy directly.

---

## Human Systems

**Definition**
Collectives in which coordination and stability emerge through interpretation and response rather than direct control.

---

# LEDGER GOVERNANCE RULES

1. **Core concepts cannot be casually revised**
2. **Supporting concepts may evolve**, but must remain consistent with core logic
3. Imported concepts **must never be presented as original**
4. ICT.html may simplify language but may not change meaning
5. The working paper may extend theory only after ledger revision

---

## End of Concept Ledger

If you want next, we can:

* Produce a **one-page reviewer defense map keyed to this ledger**
* Generate a **“safe simplification” matrix for ICT.html**
* Or lock this into a **versioned governance workflow** so future edits don’t drift
