                <h3>Why Dialogue Sometimes Transforms Organizations - and Sometimes Doesn’t</h3>
                <p><strong>Dialogic OD, persistence, and the missing explanatory layer provided by Interpretive Conditions Theory (ICT).</strong><br>
                    <span>Matthew Carlson</span></p>
            </header>
            <section id="intro">
                <p>
                    Dialogic Organization Development (Dialogic OD) rests on a powerful insight: organizations change when the conversations that constitute them change.
                    New narratives, generative images, and shared meanings open possibilities that were previously unavailable. In contrast to diagnostic models that treat
                    organizations as problems to be solved, Dialogic OD treats organizations as living meaning-making systems.
                </p>

                <p>Yet a persistent puzzle remains.</p>

                <p>
                    Dialogic processes can produce deep insight, emotional commitment, and shared understanding and still fail to produce durable organizational change.
                    Participants leave inspired, only to return to environments where old patterns quickly reassert themselves. The dialogue was real. The commitment was sincere.
                    The change did not hold.
                </p>

                <p><strong>Interpretive Conditions Theory (ICT) explains why.</strong></p>
            </section>

            <hr />

            <section id="limitation">
                <h3>The Core Limitation in Dialogic OD Theory</h3>

                <p>
                    Dialogic OD has been exceptionally strong in explaining how new meaning emerges. It has been less explicit about how meaning becomes organizationally binding,
                    or why some meanings stabilize while others dissipate.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In much of the Dialogic OD literature (e.g., Bushe, Marshak), persistence is often attributed to narrative resonance, emotional energy, or leadership sponsorship.
                    These factors matter, but they are insufficient.
                </p>

                <p><strong>ICT introduces the missing explanatory layer:</strong></p>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>
                        Organizations do not change because people agree on new meanings. They change when people repeatedly choose to act on those meanings under conditions
                        they interpret as legitimate.
                    </p>
                </blockquote>

                <p>ICT shifts the focus from the moment of insight to the moment of enactment.</p>

                <h3>The Theoretical Lineage of ICT</h3>

                <p>
                    ICT is grounded in Institutional Theory and Structuration Theory, providing a bridge between discursive meaning and structural persistence.
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>From Institutional Theory:</strong> ICT draws on legitimacy as the central orienting concept and sedimentation as the process by which patterns become taken for granted.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>From Structuration Theory (e.g., Giddens):</strong> ICT adopts the recursive relationship between action and structure. Structures are both the medium and the outcome of action.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>A Non-Teleological Stance:</strong> ICT rejects evolutionary or population-selection models. It is non-teleological; there is no predetermined end-state.
                        Change is an ongoing, reversible process of overwriting history through agency.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <hr />

            <section id="loop">
                <h3>The Central Claim: The High-Velocity Recursive Loop</h3>

                <p>
                    ICT proposes that organizational behavior is shaped by a continuous, high-frequency recursive loop.
                </p>

                <p>
                    High-velocity refers not to efficiency or optimization, but to the ordinary, continuous pace at which actors interpret conditions, choose responses,
                    and update their sense of what is legitimate in everyday work.
                </p>

                <p>The loop operates as follows:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Conditions shape interpretation</strong><br />Actors read the environment for cues about what is safe, sensible, or expected.</li>
                    <li><strong>Interpretation informs choice</strong><br />Actors decide how to respond based on perceived asymmetries of risk: the differential exposure to consequence associated with action.</li>
                    <li><strong>Choice guides response</strong><br />Agency is exercised through enactment.</li>
                    <li><strong>Repeated responses sediment into structures</strong><br />Each enactment is potentially inscribed as a trace in organizational memory, though not all traces carry equal weight.</li>
                    <li><strong>Structures shape future interpretation</strong><br />These traces become conditions for the next cycle.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Nothing happens automatically.</strong> Persistence is produced through repeated choice.</p>

            <section id="dialogue-enactment">
                <h3>Dialogue as Simultaneous Enactment</h3>

                <p>
                    A core tenet of ICT is that dialogue and conditions are simultaneous and continuous.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A dialogic event is not a prelude to change; it is a concentrated burst of new inscriptions onto organizational memory.
                    The dialogic space functions as a lab environment in which new interpretive conditions are temporarily manufactured and immediately added to participants’ histories.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The reversion trap occurs because the lab environment is temporary.
                </p>

                <p>
                    When actors leave the dialogic space, they encounter older, deeper, and more heavily weighted inscriptions of the broader organization.
                    They are not failing to commit. They are navigating more established, higher-risk traces of the existing structure.

                <h3>Legitimacy as an Interpretive Orientation Under Risk</h3>

                <p>ICT places legitimacy at the center of organizational change.</p>

                <p>
                    Legitimacy is not a level-of-analysis construct. It is an interpretive orientation that operates wherever actors must decide how to respond under conditions of uncertainty.
                </p>

                <p>Crucially, legitimacy is interpreted through asymmetries of risk and consequence. However, legitimacy is not reducible to risk itself.</p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Legitimacy is how a possibility is interpreted as sensible, appropriate, or viable action in light of potential consequences.</strong>
                </p>

                <p>
                    What appears as a generative opportunity for a senior leader may appear as high-stakes exposure for a frontline employee.
                    Non-action is often a rational interpretation of conditions judged illegitimate for enactment, not a failure of commitment or courage.
                </p>

                <p>Legitimacy is:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Phenomenological</strong> - a felt sense of whether an action is worth the likely consequence</li>
                    <li><strong>Relational</strong> - how meanings are negotiated, reinforced, or corrected in interaction</li>
                    <li><strong>Institutional</strong> - when action becomes obvious and legitimacy collapses into structure</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Legitimacy operates across a continuum of consciousness:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Contested/Negotiated Legitimacy:</strong> Exists when actors must explicitly decide or justify an action. This is where most change efforts live.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Sedimented/Taken-for-granted Legitimacy:</strong> Occurs when an action becomes so appropriate and normal that alternatives are no longer considered.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    Sedimentation is not the end of legitimacy; it is its most powerful state.
                    When an action moves from a conscious choice to a routine, its legitimacy has become part of the organization’s taken-for-granted reality.

                <h3>Structures as the Organizational Palimpsest</h3>

                <p>Structures are not hierarchies or policies. They are remembered patterns of response.</p>

                <p>
                    ICT conceptualizes organizational memory as a palimpsest: a layered history of past actions and their consequences that remains partially visible in the present.
                </p>

                <p>Key properties of the palimpsest:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Distributed memory</strong><br />Memory exists as layered impressions across actors, not as a centralized store.</li>
                    <li><strong>Weight of the trace</strong><br />Not all enactments are equal. Highly visible, high-stakes actions carry more sedimentation weight than routine or private ones.</li>
                    <li><strong>Overwriting</strong><br />Structures change only when new interpretations are enacted with enough weight or frequency to overwrite the remembered consequences of prior action.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <hr />

            <section id="agreed">
                <h3>Why “Everyone Agreed—and Nothing Changed” Makes Sense</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li>A dialogic space can feel safe while the organization remains unsafe.</li>
                    <li>Agreement is an interpretive event.</li>
                    <li>Structure is a history of enacted responses.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    When actors leave a dialogic space, they carry not only the new agreement, but also the accumulated memory of what has happened in the past when similar actions were attempted.
                    In the next moment requiring action, actors implicitly consult that memory:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>What happened last time?</li>
                    <li>What actually works here?</li>
                    <li>What am I likely to be exposed to?</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    If new interpretations are not enacted, and enacted repeatedly, the organizational memory remains oriented toward the old pattern.
                    Non-action quietly reinscribes the existing structure.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Structures change only when new interpretations are enacted with enough weight or frequency to overwrite remembered consequences.

                <h3>Agency, Collective Choice, and Stewardship</h3>

                <p>Agency is the capacity to act differently. Everyone has it.</p>

                <p>
                    The cost of exercising agency varies with the contour of the palimpsest.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Stewardship of Conditions:</strong> Leadership is the act of altering conditions others respond to, most powerfully by lowering the perceived risk of new enactments
                    or by creating new possibilities that make generative action more viable.
                </p>

                <p><strong>Collective enactment</strong></p>

                <p>
                    Coordinated action redistributes exposure, making new responses safer to repeat and accelerating structural overwriting.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Collective choice is not assumed. It is enacted.

                <h3>Synthesis: The Missing Chapter of DOD</h3>

                <p>
                    Interpretive Conditions Theory does not compete with Dialogic OD; it completes it.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Dialogic OD explains how new meanings emerge and how conversations open possibility.
                    ICT explains how actors decide whether those meanings are legitimate to enact, and how organizations learn what is normal through repetition under risk.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If Dialogic OD is the how of generative change, ICT is the why it lasts.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Dialogue generates the ink. Agency does the writing. Repetition, weighted by risk and visibility, creates the structure.
