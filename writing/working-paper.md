## ABSTRACT

Why do organizational practices persist despite contested legitimacy? Institutional theory explains how legitimacy enables persistence, but struggles to explain patterns that endure when members question their value. This paper introduces Interpretive Conditions Theory (ICT), which predicts and explains a distinct organizational state: *contested equilibrium*—high coordination paired with persistently contested legitimacy. ICT specifies a micro-to-meso causal mechanism: environmental cues from six organizational domains trigger heuristic processing that generates three-dimensional legitimacy judgments (safe, acceptable, worthwhile), producing coordinated responses that become encoded in habits and distributed memory. Critically, coordination can stabilize through enforcement, dependencies, and Type 2 habits (context-cued automaticity without legitimacy) even when legitimacy remains contested. The theory generates testable predictions about when coordination and legitimacy decouple, why contested equilibria persist, and where to intervene to shift patterns. Empirical validation uses dimension-profile measurement, disruption tests, and domain cue consistency analysis. This framework provides mechanistic explanation for widespread organizational phenomena—performance reviews, open office plans, compliance training—where practices are routinely enacted yet persistently questioned.

## INTRODUCTION

Consider the annual performance review. In most organizations, managers dutifully complete forms, employees prepare self-assessments, and meetings are scheduled—high coordination, predictable enactment. Yet surveys consistently reveal skepticism: managers believe reviews consume time without improving performance; employees see them as bureaucratic theater; both question whether the practice achieves its stated purpose (Adler et al., 2016). The practice persists not because it has become taken-for-granted, but *despite* ongoing contestation.

Institutional theory provides powerful explanations for why practices persist through legitimacy (Meyer & Rowan, 1977; Zucker, 1977). When practices become taken-for-granted, they persist because legitimacy has converged—alternatives become unthinkable. But what explains persistence when legitimacy remains contested? When practices are routinely enacted yet perpetually questioned? When coordination is high but consensus elusive?

This paper introduces Interpretive Conditions Theory (ICT), which explains how organizational patterns can achieve high coordination without legitimacy consensus through a phenomenon we term *contested equilibrium*. Unlike institutional theory, which explains why institutions persist through legitimacy convergence, ICT explains *why coordination can persist without legitimacy convergence*—a distinct organizational state with different formation mechanisms and stability conditions.

### The Theoretical Puzzle

Institutional theory emphasizes that practices become institutionalized through progressive legitimation (Tolbert & Zucker, 1996). Practices move from contested (habitualization) through semi-institutionalized (objectification) to fully institutionalized (sedimentation) as legitimacy converges. The endpoint is taken-for-grantedness: practices become so legitimate that questioning them seems strange (Zucker, 1977).

Yet many organizational practices exhibit a different pattern. They achieve stable coordination—everyone does them, tools support them, metrics track them—but legitimacy remains contested. People comply while privately doubting worth. Practices become routine without becoming taken-for-granted. This creates a theoretical puzzle: if legitimacy drives institutionalization, how do practices stabilize when legitimacy doesn't converge?

Existing explanations partially address this puzzle. Decoupling theory shows practices can be symbolically adopted without operational enactment (Meyer & Rowan, 1977), but contested equilibrium involves real, sustained enactment. Means-ends decoupling demonstrates practices can be implemented without achieving outcomes (Bromley & Powell, 2012), but doesn't explain the coordination persistence mechanisms. Legitimacy research reveals validity can mask heterogeneity (Haack, Schilke, & Zucker, 2021), but doesn't specify how patterns form when validity is low.

### Theoretical Contribution

ICT makes three primary contributions. First, it identifies contested equilibrium as a distinct, stable organizational state that institutional theory doesn't predict: high coordination persisting alongside contested legitimacy. Second, it specifies the micro-to-meso mechanisms that produce and sustain this state: domain cues → heuristic processing → multi-dimensional legitimacy profiles → coordinated responses → Type 2 habits + enforcement + dependencies → pattern persistence. Third, it generates falsifiable predictions about when coordination and legitimacy decouple, which practices become contested equilibria, and how to disrupt them.

The paper proceeds as follows. We first review relevant literature on institutional theory, legitimacy, and organizational patterns. We then develop ICT's core propositions, specifying the causal mechanisms linking environmental conditions to pattern formation. Next, we detail the measurement approach for empirical validation. We conclude by discussing theoretical implications, practical applications, and future research directions.

## THEORETICAL FOUNDATIONS

### Institutional Theory and Legitimacy

Institutional theory provides our foundational understanding of how practices persist through legitimacy (DiMaggio & Powell, 1983; Meyer & Rowan, 1977; Zucker, 1977). Institutions are defined as "social structures that have attained a high degree of resilience" (Scott, 2001, p. 48), persisting because they become taken-for-granted—seen as natural, appropriate, or inevitable.

Tolbert and Zucker (1996) specify institutionalization as a process: practices move from pre-institutionalized (habitualization) through semi-institutionalized (objectification) to fully institutionalized (sedimentation). The engine of progression is legitimation—practices become progressively more accepted as appropriate. When practices achieve full institutionalization, they become taken-for-granted; alternatives seem unthinkable.

Recent legitimacy research has refined our understanding of this process. Haack, Schilke, and Zucker (2021) distinguish propriety (normative appropriateness), validity (taken-for-granted status), and consensus (agreement). Critically, they show these can vary independently: practices can have high validity (widely adopted, leadership endorsed) while consensus remains low (significant disagreement about appropriateness). This "validity-consensus incongruity" can create "silenced heterogeneity"—people comply despite private doubts because high validity signals institutionalization.

Tost (2011) provides a complementary judgment-based view of legitimacy. Rather than treating legitimacy as a property of institutions, Tost shows legitimacy operates through individual judgments along instrumental (does it work?), relational (is it socially appropriate?), and moral (is it ethically right?) dimensions. These judgments aggregate through social processes to create collective legitimacy assessments.

### Decoupling and Related Phenomena

Decoupling theory addresses misalignment between formal structure and operational practice (Meyer & Rowan, 1977). Organizations adopt practices symbolically to gain external legitimacy while maintaining operational independence. Classic decoupling involves weak coupling between policy and practice—practices are endorsed but minimally enacted.

Bromley and Powell (2012) identify means-ends decoupling as a distinct form: practices are fully implemented but disconnected from intended outcomes. This captures situations where practices are operationally real but ineffective. However, means-ends decoupling research focuses on outcome misalignment rather than persistence mechanisms—it documents *what* happens but doesn't explain *how* patterns sustain when ineffective.

Organizational hypocrisy (Brunsson, 1989) describes divergence between talk, decisions, and actions to manage contradictory demands. Legitimacy facades (Elsbach & Sutton, 1992) involve external presentations that mask internal reality. While these constructs address misalignment, they differ from contested equilibrium in focus: decoupling emphasizes symbolic vs. operational adoption; hypocrisy emphasizes contradiction management; facades emphasize external impression management. Contested equilibrium emphasizes operational enactment with internal legitimacy contestation.

### Habit and Automaticity

Habit research demonstrates that repeated behaviors can become automatic through context-cue associations, operating without conscious goal mediation (Wood & Neal, 2007). Habits form through repetition in stable contexts and persist through context-cued triggering. Critically, habit formation doesn't require that people value the behavior—habits can form and persist purely through repetition, convenience, or friction reduction (Wood, Tam, & Witt, 2005).

This insight is crucial for understanding contested equilibrium. If automatic behavior required legitimacy, we couldn't explain how practices become routine while remaining contested. But if habits can form through repeated exposure regardless of belief, coordination can stabilize through automaticity even when legitimacy doesn't converge.

### Procedural Justice and Authority Legitimacy

Tyler's (1990) procedural justice research shows people comply with authorities they perceive as fair and legitimate, even when outcomes are unfavorable. Fair procedures signal authority legitimacy, which promotes compliance through internalized obligation rather than external enforcement.

However, Tyler's focus is authority legitimacy (whether leaders/institutions are legitimate) rather than action legitimacy (whether specific practices are appropriate). ICT addresses action legitimacy while treating authority legitimacy as one cue among many. Fair authorities may promote compliance, but this doesn't guarantee practices become viewed as worthwhile—people may comply with fair leaders while believing mandated practices are pointless.

### Gap in Current Theory

The reviewed literature provides essential building blocks but leaves a gap: we understand how legitimacy enables persistence (institutional theory), how validity can mask heterogeneity (legitimacy research), and how habits form through repetition (habit research), but we lack a unified framework explaining *how coordination persists when legitimacy doesn't converge*—specifying the mechanisms, predicting when it occurs, and identifying intervention points.

ICT addresses this gap by integrating insights across these literatures into a mechanistic framework explaining contested equilibrium formation, persistence, and disruption.

## CORE THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK

### Foundational Claim

ICT's central claim: **Coordination and legitimacy are distinct phenomena that can vary independently.** High coordination (synchronized behavioral enactment) can persist alongside contested legitimacy (persistent disagreement about whether practices are safe, acceptable, or worthwhile). This independence creates contested equilibrium—a stable organizational state institutional theory doesn't predict.

### The Causal Loop

ICT specifies a micro-to-meso causal mechanism operating recursively:

**Environmental Conditions → Cues → Heuristic Processing → Legitimacy Judgments → Response → Coordinated Enactment → Distributed Memory → New Conditions**

Each element requires specification:

#### 1. Environmental Conditions

Conditions are publicly observable features of the organizational environment that people encounter when deciding how to act. Critically, "observable" means "capable of being perceived through any sense" not "actually noticed by everyone." Conditions include what people say and do, what tools allow or prevent, what gets measured and rewarded, what norms emerge through storytelling, what authority structures enable, and what skills are available.

ICT organizes conditions into six domains representing distinct cue sources. Each domain operates through three mechanisms: structural (enabling/constraining action), signaling (revealing priorities and expectations), and cognitive (shaping mental models and language).

**Data & Feedback:** What information is visible, measured, reviewed. Structural: measurable phenomena can be tracked; signaling: measurement signals importance; cognitive: available metrics shape perception.

**Tools & Processes:** Systems, workflows, procedures. Structural: tools determine feasibility; signaling: investment signals priorities; cognitive: tools provide language and categories for understanding work.

**Capacity:** Time, authority, resources allocated. Structural: resources enable action; signaling: allocation signals value; cognitive: scarcity shapes perceived possibilities.

**Skills & Knowledge:** Training, expertise, competencies. Structural: skills determine capability; signaling: training investment signals expectations; cognitive: expertise shapes problem framing.

**Motivation & Values:** Consequences, incentives, rewards. Structural: consequences shape risk; signaling: rewards reveal priorities; cognitive: incentive systems frame "winning."

**Norms & Expectations:** Collective interpretations encoded in stories and social interactions. Structural: norms create social consequences; signaling: stories reveal expectations; cognitive: narratives provide sense-making frames.

The first five domains contain designed, controllable conditions. The sixth (Norms) emerges from collective interpretation through social processes—it cannot be directly mandated but forms through distributed sense-making encoded in stories about "what happened when."

#### 2. Cues and Heuristic Processing

People don't process all environmental conditions systematically. Instead, they use heuristics—cognitive shortcuts that enable rapid judgment with limited information (Gigerenzer & Gaissmaier, 2011). ICT incorporates three heuristics particularly relevant to organizational legitimacy:

**Authority heuristic:** "If leadership endorses this, it's likely legitimate." Triggered by observing leader behavior, policy endorsement, resource allocation.

**Consensus heuristic:** "If people like me do this, it's appropriate." Triggered by observing peer behavior, widespread adoption, social norms.

**Consequence heuristic:** "If bad things happen when violated, avoid it; if good things happen when enacted, do it." Triggered by observing outcomes following action/inaction.

Additionally, macro validity—the institutionalized perception that a practice is appropriate (Haack et al., 2021)—can function as a meta-cue that amplifies authority and consensus heuristics. When practices have high validity, people weight leadership endorsement and widespread adoption more heavily, potentially overriding local domain inconsistencies.

#### 3. Three-Dimensional Legitimacy Judgments

Drawing on Tost's (2011) framework, ICT assesses legitimacy along three dimensions reflecting different judgment criteria:

**Safe?** "Will I be punished for attempting this? Will this harm relationships or standing? Is this risky given what happened to others?"

**Acceptable?** "Is this what people like me do here? Will I be excluded if I don't comply? Does this fit how we work?"

**Worthwhile?** "Is this worth effort given competing demands? Does this align with what I believe is meaningful? Is this real work or theater?"

These dimensions can vary independently. A practice can be judged safe and acceptable (compliance expected, no punishment for conformity) while contested on worthwhile (people doubt value). This dimensional independence enables contested equilibrium: people coordinate behavior (safe + acceptable drive compliance) despite contested legitimacy (worthwhile disputed).

#### 4. Response and Coordinated Enactment

Legitimacy judgments shape behavioral responses. When all three dimensions show consensus that a practice is legitimate, people enact it willingly. When safe and acceptable show consensus but worthwhile is contested, people comply (avoiding risk, conforming to norms) despite private doubts. When safety is contested, people may avoid the practice even if they believe it's worthwhile.

Coordination emerges when many people respond similarly to similar cues. High coordination means >80% of relevant actors enact the practice routinely (working heuristic requiring validation). Coordination creates dependencies: tools assume participation, processes require compliance, social expectations solidify.

#### 5. Habits and Distributed Memory

With repeated enactment, patterns become encoded in two ways:

**Type 1 Habits (Legitimacy-Based):** Automatic responses driven by internalized belief. People habitually enact because legitimacy has converged—they judge the practice safe, acceptable, and worthwhile. These habits persist even when context changes because legitimacy sustains them.

**Type 2 Habits (Coordination-Based):** Automatic responses driven by context cues, repetition, and friction reduction, independent of legitimacy judgments. People habitually comply because: (a) repetition creates neural pathway efficiency, (b) tools make it the easiest path, (c) opt-out creates friction, (d) enforcement ensures repeated exposure. These habits persist while legitimacy remains contested, sustained by context stability not belief.

**Distributed Memory** forms as collective interpretations stabilize through storytelling. People encode legitimacy judgments in narratives: "We tried X and Y happened," "When Z questioned it, here's what occurred." These stories become organizational memory, shaping future interpretations without requiring centralized storage.

#### 6. Feedback Loop

Enacted patterns create new environmental conditions. When practices are routinely enacted:
- They appear in Data & Feedback (measured, tracked)
- They're embedded in Tools & Processes (systems built around them)
- They consume Capacity (time, resources allocated)
- They require Skills & Knowledge (training provided)
- They're reinforced through Motivation (rewarded, expected)
- They generate Norms (stories encode expectations)

New conditions provide new cues, triggering new interpretations. If domain cues align (all pointing toward legitimacy), interpretations converge. If domains contradict (tools say "do this" but rewards say "prioritize that"), interpretations diverge.

**Macro validity emerges recursively:** Sustained coordination creates distributed memory of "this is what we do," which becomes taken-for-granted status (high validity), which then functions as a meta-cue shaping future judgments. Validity is both output (emerges from sustained coordination) and input (shapes subsequent interpretation).

## CONTESTED EQUILIBRIUM: THE DISTINCTIVE PHENOMENON

### Definition and Forms

**Contested Equilibrium** is an organizational state characterized by:
- High coordination (>80% behavioral compliance)
- Contested legitimacy profile (one or more dimensions, typically worthwhile, show high variance SD > 1.5)

ICT identifies two common forms:

**Form 1: Institutionalized Contested Equilibrium (High Validity)**
- Coordination sustained by macro validity ("this is how things are done")
- Leaders endorse, policies codify, widespread apparent adoption
- Legitimacy contestation is silenced—people privately doubt but publicly comply
- Mechanism: Validity functions as meta-cue amplifying authority/consensus heuristics
- Example: Annual performance reviews are institutionalized practice; questioning them seems deviant despite private skepticism

**Form 2: Enforced Contested Equilibrium (Low-Moderate Validity)**
- Coordination sustained by enforcement, dependencies, Type 2 habits
- Practice openly questioned, alternatives discussed, leaders acknowledge concerns
- Legitimacy contestation is overt—people publicly express doubts
- Mechanism: Enforcement ensures compliance, dependencies make opt-out costly, habits maintain routine
- Example: Mandated return-to-office policies enforced despite widespread questioning

### Mechanisms of Persistence

Why do contested equilibria persist? Three mechanisms operate:

**1. Type 2 Habits**
Once practices become automatic through repetition, people enact them without conscious deliberation. Habits persist through context-cue triggering regardless of legitimacy beliefs. Even if people believe a practice is pointless, if the context cue remains stable (daily calendar reminder, required form submission), the habitual response continues.

**2. Enforcement and Dependencies**
When compliance is monitored and non-compliance sanctioned, people conform despite contestation. Additionally, coordination creates dependencies: if 80% use a tool, the 20% face high opt-out costs (incompatibility, isolation, friction).

**3. Domain Misalignment**
When high-control domains (Data, Tools, Capacity) align around a practice but low-control domain (Norms) doesn't, coordination can precede legitimacy convergence. Tools mandate usage, metrics track activity, resources are allocated—creating coordination. But stories circulate questioning worth—maintaining contestation. Pattern stabilizes because high-control domains can be altered quickly (through executive decision) while norms emerge slowly (through social process).

### Prediction: When Contested Equilibrium Forms

ICT generates testable predictions about when practices become contested equilibria rather than taken-for-granted or decoupled:

**Contested Equilibrium predicted when:**
- High-control domains align (Data, Tools, Capacity drive coordination)
- Enforcement is strong and consistent
- Safe and acceptable dimensions show consensus
- Worthwhile dimension shows contestation
- Practice is means-ends decoupled (implemented but not achieving intended outcomes)

**Taken-for-granted predicted when:**
- All six domains align (including Norms)
- All three legitimacy dimensions show consensus
- Type 1 habits form (legitimacy-based)
- Macro validity is high

**Decoupling predicted when:**
- Weak enforcement
- Low coordination despite high validity claims
- Symbolic adoption without operational enactment

## EMPIRICAL VALIDATION FRAMEWORK

### Measurement Approach

ICT's empirical validation uses dimension-profile measurement combined with behavioral observation and disruption testing.

#### Legitimacy Consensus Profiles

**Survey Measurement (Per Dimension):**

Safe dimension:
- "Taking [action] is risky in this organization" (reverse scored)
- "People are punished for [action]" (reverse scored)
- "It's safe to [action]"

Acceptable dimension:
- "People like me regularly [action]"
- "Not [actioning] would seem strange to my colleagues"
- "[Action] is what we do here"

Worthwhile dimension:
- "[Action] is worth the time it requires"
- "[Action] actually achieves its stated purpose"
- "[Action] is meaningful work, not compliance theater"

7-point Likert scale for each item. Calculate mean and SD per dimension.

**Classification:**
- Contested: SD > 1.5 (high variance, fundamental disagreement)
- Routine: SD 0.8-1.5 (moderate consensus)
- Taken-for-granted: SD < 0.8 (high consensus)

**Note:** Thresholds are measurement conveniences enabling empirical work, not theoretical constants. Different contexts may warrant different cutoffs. Theory claims: disagreement patterns matter; specific SD values are operational definitions.

**Profile Construction:**

Create three-dimensional profile showing consensus level for each dimension:

Contested equilibrium typical profile:
- Safe: Taken-for-granted (SD 0.6)
- Acceptable: Routine-to-consensus (SD 1.0)
- Worthwhile: Contested (SD 1.8)

Interpretation: People comply (safe + acceptable consensus) despite doubting worth (contested).

#### Coordination Measurement

**Behavioral compliance:**
- Observation: What % of relevant actors routinely enact practice?
- Log analysis: What % complete required activities?
- Meeting attendance: What % participate in mandated sessions?

Working heuristic: >80% indicates high coordination.

#### Validity Indicators

**Institutionalization signals:**
- Policy codification (written procedures, formal requirements)
- Leadership endorsement (executive communication, resource allocation)
- Tool embedding (systems built around practice)
- Widespread adoption (>80% apparent compliance)
- Lack of questioning (alternatives not openly discussed)

High validity when most indicators present. Low validity when questioning is overt.

### Disruption Tests

To distinguish Type 1 (legitimacy-based) from Type 2 (coordination-based) habits, conduct disruption tests that alter cue constellations:

**Protocol:**
1. Remove enforcement mechanisms
2. Change tools or processes (alter context cues)
3. Shift metrics (remove tracking/rewards)
4. Observe pattern persistence/collapse

**Type 1 habit (legitimacy-based):**
- Persists even when cue constellation changes
- Legitimacy sustains despite context shift
- People continue because they believe it's worthwhile

**Type 2 habit (coordination-based):**
- Collapses when cue constellation changes
- Pattern was sustained by context not belief
- Reveals contested equilibrium (coordination without legitimacy)

**Critical:** Removing enforcement alone doesn't test habit type. If alternative cues remain (peer monitoring, tool ease), Type 2 habits can persist. Must disrupt comprehensive cue constellation.

### Domain Cue Consistency Analysis

Measure cue alignment across six domains:

For each domain, assess: Do cues signal practice is legitimate?

**Data & Feedback:** Is practice measured, tracked, reviewed positively?
**Tools & Processes:** Do systems enable/require practice?
**Capacity:** Are time/resources allocated?
**Skills & Knowledge:** Is training provided?
**Motivation & Values:** Is practice rewarded?
**Norms & Expectations:** Do stories endorse practice?

**Prediction:** Legitimacy convergence requires consistency in at least four domains, including Norms (working heuristic requiring validation).

**Contested equilibrium pattern:** High-control domains (Data, Tools, Capacity) align; Norms domain doesn't.

## RELATIONSHIP TO EXISTING THEORY

### Institutional Theory

ICT doesn't compete with institutional theory; it provides within-organization mechanistic specification for a phenomenon institutional theory identifies: structures persist through legitimacy.

**What institutional theory provides:** Phenomenon class (institutions/legitimacy) and explanation for why institutions persist (legitimacy enables taken-for-grantedness).

**What ICT provides:** Within-organization causal mechanism explaining HOW legitimacy forms (cue-heuristic processing), WHEN coordination and legitimacy decouple (domain misalignment), and WHY patterns persist without legitimacy (Type 2 habits + enforcement + dependencies).

**Critical difference:** Institutional theory explains why institutions persist through legitimacy convergence. ICT explains why coordination can persist WITHOUT legitimacy convergence—a distinct organizational state institutional theory doesn't theorize.

### Legitimacy Research

ICT integrates and extends recent legitimacy research:

From Haack et al. (2021): Propriety-validity-consensus distinction; validity can mask heterogeneity; silenced heterogeneity as organizational pattern.

**ICT's extension:** (1) Six domain cue sources explaining WHY validity-consensus incongruity forms; (2) Type 2 habit mechanism explaining HOW patterns persist when validity is low; (3) Form 1 vs Form 2 contested equilibrium distinction mapping to high vs low validity.

From Tost (2011): Legitimacy as judgment along instrumental/relational/moral dimensions.

**ICT's extension:** Operationalization as safe/acceptable/worthwhile dimensions; dimension-profile measurement enabling empirical detection; dimensional independence explaining contested equilibrium.

**Relationship:** Haack et al. and ICT are empirical cousins, not identical constructs. Haack et al. disentangle legitimacy facets; ICT provides organizational mechanisms. Form 1 contested equilibrium (high validity + low consensus) maps closely to their validity-consensus incongruity. ICT adds cue sources, habit mechanisms, and disruption predictions.

### Decoupling Theory

**Means-ends decoupling (Bromley & Powell, 2012):** Practices implemented but disconnected from outcomes.

**ICT relationship:** These are different explanatory targets that can empirically overlap.
- Means-ends decoupling documents WHAT (outcome misalignment)
- ICT explains HOW (coordination persistence mechanisms)

When a practice is both means-ends decoupled (doesn't achieve outcomes) AND contested equilibrium (mechanisms sustaining coordination without legitimacy):
- Means-ends decoupling may explain WHY worthwhile is contested (practice fails)
- ICT explains HOW coordination persists DESPITE failure (habits, enforcement, dependencies)

### Habit Research

ICT integrates Wood & Neal's (2007) habit-goal interface model:
- Habits are context-cued responses operating without goal mediation
- Form through repetition in stable contexts
- Disrupted by context change

**ICT's extension:** Type 1 vs Type 2 habit distinction maps onto legitimacy-based vs context-cued formation, explaining why automatic behavior doesn't guarantee legitimacy.

### Procedural Justice

Tyler's (1990) research addresses authority legitimacy (whether leaders are legitimate). ICT addresses action legitimacy (whether practices are appropriate).

**Relationship:** Authority legitimacy functions as cue for action legitimacy through Capacity domain (how authority exercised) and Motivation domain (whose interests served). Fair procedures promote compliance but don't guarantee practices are viewed as worthwhile—explaining "fairly imposed but still pointless" contested equilibria.

## DISCUSSION

### Theoretical Implications

ICT makes several contributions to organizational theory:

**1. Identifies contested equilibrium as distinct organizational state**

Institutional theory predicts practices move toward taken-for-grantedness through legitimation. ICT identifies a stable endpoint institutional theory doesn't predict: high coordination persisting alongside contested legitimacy. This is not failed institutionalization but a stable state with its own formation mechanisms.

**2. Specifies micro-to-meso mechanisms**

Unlike theories that correlate factors with outcomes, ICT specifies a complete causal loop: conditions → cues → heuristics → judgments → responses → habits → memory → new conditions. This mechanistic specification enables prediction and intervention.

**3. Explains coordination-legitimacy independence**

By distinguishing coordination mechanisms (Type 2 habits, enforcement, dependencies) from legitimacy mechanisms (Type 1 habits, internalization, value alignment), ICT explains how patterns persist when legitimacy doesn't converge. Coordination and legitimacy are empirically correlated but causally separable.

**4. Provides diagnostic framework**

The six-domain framework enables within-organization diagnosis: which domains align? Which contradict? Where are cues inconsistent? This diagnostic capacity supports both research (identifying contested equilibria) and practice (targeting interventions).

### Practical Implications

For practitioners, ICT offers several insights:

**1. Not all persistent patterns are legitimate**

Routine enactment doesn't guarantee legitimacy convergence. High coordination can mask contested legitimacy. Leaders should measure legitimacy dimensions separately, not assume compliance indicates endorsement.

**2. Domain alignment matters more than persuasion**

Changing minds is difficult; changing environmental conditions is more tractable. If domains send contradictory cues, legitimacy won't converge regardless of messaging quality. Intervention should target domain cue consistency.

**3. Contested equilibria are stable but brittle**

Type 2 habits sustain contested equilibria through context stability. Small context changes can cascade: if cue constellation shifts (tools removed, metrics changed, enforcement lapses), coordination can collapse suddenly. Patterns appearing stable may be fragile.

**4. High-control domain changes can create contested equilibria**

Leaders can quickly change Data, Tools, Capacity (executive decision). But Norms emerge slowly (social process). Rapid high-control changes without norm cultivation risk creating contested equilibria—high coordination without legitimacy.

### Limitations and Future Research

**Scope:** ICT explains within-organization pattern persistence and treats field-level dynamics as exogenous. Future research could extend to field-level contested equilibria (industry practices routinely enacted yet widely questioned).

**Cultural variation:** Legitimacy dimensions and heuristic weighting may vary across cultural contexts. Research is needed on how national/organizational culture moderates cue interpretation.

**Thresholds:** The working heuristics (80% coordination, SD > 1.5 contested) require empirical validation across contexts. What threshold levels apply in different settings?

**Longitudinal dynamics:** How do contested equilibria evolve? Under what conditions do they transition to taken-for-grantedness or collapse? Longitudinal research is needed.

**Power and politics:** While ICT addresses enforcement and authority, more work is needed on how actors strategically manipulate domain cues to shape legitimacy formation.

**Positive contested equilibria:** This paper emphasizes contested equilibria as problematic (coordination without belief). But some may be beneficial—practices that work despite skepticism, or productive questioning that prevents complacency.

## CONCLUSION

This paper introduced Interpretive Conditions Theory to explain a widespread but under-theorized organizational phenomenon: practices that achieve high coordination while legitimacy remains contested. Performance reviews, open office plans, compliance training, and numerous other practices are routinely enacted yet persistently questioned.

ICT's contribution is mechanistic explanation: contested equilibria form when high-control domains create coordination faster than low-control domains enable legitimacy convergence, and persist through Type 2 habits (context-cued automaticity without legitimacy), enforcement, and dependencies. This is not failed institutionalization but a stable state with distinct formation mechanisms.

The theory generates falsifiable predictions about when contested equilibria form, why they persist, and how to disrupt them. Empirical validation uses dimension-profile measurement, disruption tests, and domain cue consistency analysis. Future research should validate thresholds, explore longitudinal dynamics, examine cultural variation, and extend to field-level phenomena.

For practitioners, ICT provides diagnostic framework and intervention guidance: measure legitimacy dimensions separately, target domain cue consistency not persuasion, recognize that routine enactment may mask contestation, and anticipate that rapid high-control changes risk creating contested equilibria.

Organizational life is filled with practices we enact automatically yet question perpetually. ICT explains how this is possible, why it persists, and what might change it.
