## How to Read Interpretive Conditions Theory

Interpretive Conditions Theory is an interpretive communication theory of organizing. Rather than predicting behavior or prescribing solutions, it explains how patterns of behavior emerge and persist in human systems.

As you read, keep three things in mind:

**1. This theory explains patterns, not individuals.**

**2. "Conditions" are not attitudes or personalities.**  
The theory focuses on external conditions people encounter—such as norms, rules, tools, feedback, and constraints—and how systems learn from repeated responses to those conditions.

**3. "Structure" means patterns continuously recreated through action, not organizational charts or formal designs.**

Think of structure the way you think of language. English doesn't exist stored somewhere—it exists only in the continuous practice of speaking and writing it. No single person knows all of English. Each person holds fragments: vocabulary, grammar patterns, idioms they use. It "exists" as structure only because enough people enact overlapping-enough patterns that mutual intelligibility emerges.

If everyone stopped speaking English tomorrow, it would cease to exist as a living structure. New speakers learn it by participating, not by accessing some stored "English object."

**Organizational structures work the same way.** What we call "the culture" or "how things work here" exists only in continuous enactment. Each person holds fragments—what they've learned about what's legitimate, safe, or worthwhile. When enough people enact overlapping patterns, it feels like a shared structure. But that structure persists only through ongoing reproduction. If people stopped enacting it, it would dissolve.

This learning is displayed through what people come to take for granted: what questions are safe to ask, which risks are avoided, how decisions really get made, where work slows down, and what "everyone knows" without needing to say out loud. These shared understandings aren't written anywhere, but they reliably guide behavior.

This is what people often describe informally as culture—what you "just know" once you've been in a system long enough—but in Interpretive Conditions Theory, these patterns are treated as visible evidence of what the system has learned from past responses, rather than taking stated values or attitudes as the primary explanatory driver.

Read Interpretive Conditions Theory as an explanation of how organizing works when people interpret their environment and respond to what feels legitimate, risky, or possible—and how those responses, repeated and overlapping, create patterns that persist only through continuous reenactment.

As with many interpretive theories, the value of Interpretive Conditions Theory lies not in prediction, but in helping you see what is shaping behavior that might otherwise feel confusing or irrational.

## Theory

**Interpretive Conditions Theory** is an interpretive-institutional theory of organizing that explains persistent patterns of behavior as responses to conditions people interpret as legitimate, risky, or worthwhile over time. Rather than viewing organizations as systems that execute plans or individuals as actors who simply follow rules, the theory conceptualizes organizing as an ongoing process of interpretation and response shaped by environmental conditions.

Interpretive Conditions Theory treats people as active agents who interpret and respond to conditions, exercising agency within constraints rather than responding as if behavior were mechanically determined.

In Interpretive Conditions Theory, organizing unfolds through a recurring dynamic: conditions shape what is visible and possible; legitimacy orients what actions make sense; agency determines how people respond; and repeated responses create patterns that guide future behavior.

From this perspective, people do not primarily change behavior because they are instructed to do so or persuaded to adopt new attitudes. Instead, behavior often emerges as a locally sensible response to what the system has taught people—through experience—about which actions are safe, expected, rewarded, or punished. Over time, these responses stabilize into patterns that guide future behavior, even when original intentions or circumstances have changed.

## Core Assumptions

Interpretive Conditions Theory rests on five central assumptions:

**1. Human systems are interpretive and agentic.**  
People actively interpret their environment and choose how to respond to it; they are not components reacting automatically to system design.

**2. Legitimacy orients action.**  
In most organizational settings, people are more likely to take (or avoid) actions that feel acceptable, safe, or worthwhile given the system's cues—often implicitly rather than through conscious deliberation.

**3. Meaning is environmentally produced.**  
Leaders rarely change beliefs or motivation reliably through messaging alone; what they can shape more consistently are the conditions people interpret and respond to.

**4. Persistence is learned, not imposed.**  
Stable patterns of behavior arise through repeated responses that become normalized over time.

**5. Change is conditional, not declarative.**  
Sustainable change occurs when the conditions people respond to shift, not when end states are announced.

## Understanding Structure as Process

Before exploring the key concepts, it's essential to understand what Interpretive Conditions Theory means by "structure," because it differs from how the term is typically used.

### Structures Don't Exist—Structuring Exists

Most organizational thinking treats structures as things: org charts, policies, systems, "the culture." These are treated as if they exist independently and influence people's behavior.

**Interpretive Conditions Theory takes a different view:**

**Structures are not things. They are patterns that exist only in continuous coordinated enactment.**

Consider how a path forms through snow. The first person makes tracks. The second finds it easier to follow those tracks. Eventually a visible path forms—but only because people keep walking it. If everyone stops using it, the next snowfall erases it. The path "remembers" where people walked, but only as long as walking continues.

Organizational structures work the same way. They persist not because they're stored somewhere, but because people continue to enact learned responses. When we say "the structure" persists, what we mean is: **people keep recreating the pattern.**

### Memory Is Distributed, Not Stored

When ICT talks about "organizational memory," it doesn't mean information stored in a database or written in policies.

**It means: what people have collectively learned through overlapping experiences about what responses are legitimate, safe, or worthwhile.**

No one person holds "the structure." Everyone holds fragments:

* What I've learned happens when I speak up
* What I've observed happens to others who tried something new
* What consequences I've experienced when I broke a rule
* What I've been rewarded for, ignored for, or punished for

When enough people have learned overlapping patterns—when our fragments align enough—it creates mutual intelligibility. We can coordinate. The pattern feels real and shared.

**But it exists nowhere except in our continuous coordinated enactment of those learned responses.**

### Multiple Structures Operate Simultaneously

Each person navigates multiple structures at any given moment:

* Work structures (organizational norms, team practices, professional identity)
* Family structures (household routines, parenting patterns, relationship dynamics)
* Community structures (neighborhood expectations, civic participation)
* National/cultural structures (language, holidays, taken-for-granted social norms)

These aren't separate "parts of life." They're different pattern-contexts, each with its own legitimacy rules, that you're constantly assessing and switching between:

* You don't talk to your boss the same way you talk to your kids
* What's funny at home might be inappropriate at work
* What's efficient with your team might be rude with your spouse

**At any moment, multiple structures are potentially relevant.**

When your boss texts at 8pm, which structure applies? Work or family time? The ambiguity creates interpretive difficulty because multiple structures are simultaneously active, each suggesting different responses.

**Organizational change often fails because it assumes people operate in a single structure.** In reality, people are navigating multiple overlapping structures, and the new organizational pattern may conflict with family structures, professional identity structures, or community structures that are equally real and consequential.

### Structures Persist Through Reenactment, Not Inertia

Because structures exist only in continuous doing, they require ongoing reproduction to persist.

**This has profound implications:**

**Change doesn't require "overcoming" structure.** It requires coordinated shifts in enactment. If people stop recreating the old pattern and start enacting a different one—and do so consistently enough that overlap emerges—a new structure forms.

**Stability doesn't mean resistance.** It means people keep finding the learned response sensible, safe, or worthwhile given the conditions they're interpreting. The pattern persists because it's continuously recreated, not because it's stored somewhere preventing change.

**"Strong cultures" aren't hard to change because they're deeply embedded.** They're hard to change because many people have learned deeply overlapping patterns, making coordination around a new pattern difficult. But if conditions shift enough that coordinated enactment shifts, even deeply learned structures can dissolve surprisingly quickly.

## Key Concepts

### Conditions

**Conditions are the environmental features people encounter and interpret as they decide how to act.**

Interpretive Conditions Theory prioritizes external, observable conditions—norms, rules, tools, feedback, constraints—as the primary analytic entry point, rather than modeling internal traits such as personality.

Conditions matter because they shape what actions feel legitimate or risky, often prior to or alongside explicit deliberation.

**Importantly, not all conditions shape behavior through interpretation alone.** Some conditions constrain action directly by limiting what is possible, regardless of how an action is interpreted:

* Tool capabilities limit what can be done
* Budget limits restrict options
* Formal authority determines permissions
* Legal requirements create boundaries
* Veto power constrains choices

These function as conditions that restrict action through **capacity and permission**, not just meaning.

However, repeated responses to these constraints also stabilize into structure over time. People learn workarounds, develop informal processes, or simply accept limitations as "how things are."

**Crucially, conditions are both input and output in a recursive loop:**

* Conditions shape how people interpret what's legitimate
* People respond based on those interpretations
* Repeated responses create new conditions (patterns others observe and respond to)
* These new conditions shape the next round of interpretation

This recursion is why organizational change is challenging: structures are simultaneously the environment people respond to AND the outcome of those responses.

### Legitimacy

**Legitimacy refers to the shared sense of what actions are acceptable, safe, or worth the effort within a system.**

It is not limited to formal authority, legality, or moral approval. In Interpretive Conditions Theory, legitimacy describes how people judge whether an action "makes sense" given the risks, norms, constraints, and past responses of the system.

**Legitimacy is learned through experience.** People infer it by observing what happens when certain actions are taken—what is rewarded, ignored, discouraged, or punished. Over time, these judgments stabilize into pattern, shaping what actions feel possible without requiring explicit instruction or enforcement.

**Legitimacy operates across a spectrum:**

**Contested legitimacy:** Actions require explicit justification or deliberation. "Should I do this? What will happen?" This is where most organizational change lives.

**Routine legitimacy:** Actions are normal and expected but still conscious. "This is what we do here."

**Taken-for-granted legitimacy:** Actions are so obvious that alternatives aren't considered. "Of course we do it this way." This is legitimacy's most powerful state—when it becomes invisible.

**Critical insight: Legitimacy is phenomenological, relational, and institutional simultaneously.**

* **Phenomenological:** A felt sense of whether an action is worth the likely consequence
* **Relational:** How meanings are negotiated, reinforced, or corrected in interaction with others
* **Institutional:** When action becomes obvious and legitimacy collapses into structure—enacted without thought

### Agency

**Agency refers to the capacity of people to choose how they respond to conditions, even when options are constrained.**

In Interpretive Conditions Theory, individuals are not passive recipients of structure; they interpret, comply, resist, adapt, and improvise based on what feels legitimate, risky, or possible.

**Agency does not imply unlimited freedom.** It is always exercised within conditions and constraints.

**But here's the critical connection to structure:**

**Agency is HOW structures are recreated or changed.**

Every moment of interpretation and response is an opportunity for:

* **Reproducing the existing pattern** (structure persists through reenactment)
* **Slight variation** (structure evolves gradually)
* **Violation** (structure is tested; what happens reveals its strength)
* **Coordinated change** (structure dissolves or transforms when enough people enact differently)

Over time, the cumulative exercise of agency—millions of small choices about how to respond—shapes and reshapes patterns. These patterns, when they become reliably coordinated, are what we call structures.

**This means structures don't constrain agency in the traditional sense.** Rather, structures are the accumulated outcome of agency exercised under past conditions, now functioning as conditions for the next round of interpretation and response.

### Domains of Influence

The theory identifies six domains through which organizational patterns are shaped and learned, operating at two distinct levels:

**Five Structural/Environmental Domains** (organizational level):
* **Data & Feedback** – what information is visible, reviewed, and acted upon
* **Tools & Processes** – formal and informal mechanisms that shape how work is done
* **Capacity** – what people have the time, authority, energy, and structural position to accomplish
* **Skills & Knowledge** – what the environment makes learnable, transferable, and usable
* **Motivation & Values** – what the system rewards, discourages, or makes meaningful

**One Collective Interpretation Domain** (social/peer level):
* **Norms & Expectations** – what behavior is taken for granted, praised, ignored, or quietly penalized; what "people like me" do; what stories circulate

**How Structural Domains Shape Patterns: Three Mechanisms**

The five structural domains don't merely exist as background conditions. They actively shape organizational patterns through three interconnected mechanisms:

**1. Structural Mechanism: Enabling and Constraining Action**

Each domain makes certain actions possible or impossible through its design and allocation:
- **Data & Feedback:** What's measured can be tracked and improved; what's invisible remains unmanaged
- **Tools & Processes:** System capabilities determine what's feasible; approval workflows gate action
- **Capacity:** Time, authority, and resources determine what's structurally possible
- **Skills & Knowledge:** What people know how to do determines accessible options
- **Motivation & Values:** Consequences shape which actions feel worth attempting

When domains create hard constraints—no time, no tool capability, no authority—coordination becomes impossible regardless of intent.

**2. Signaling Mechanism: Revealing Priorities and Legitimacy**

Domains don't just enable or constrain—their allocation and design signal what truly matters:
- **Data & Feedback:** What gets measured signals importance; what's tracked in reviews signals career impact
- **Tools & Processes:** What receives tooling investment signals priorities; what's automated vs. manual signals value
- **Capacity:** How time and authority are allocated reveals actual priorities, often contradicting verbal commitments
- **Skills & Knowledge:** What training is funded signals where the organization expects people to develop
- **Motivation & Values:** What leads to advancement reveals true values, regardless of stated culture

This signaling function explains why capacity constraints are so revealing: they show where organizations actually invest time, money, and authority—which often contradicts what leaders say matters.

**3. Cognitive Mechanism: Shaping What's Thinkable**

Perhaps most subtly, structural domains shape cognition by providing the interpretive frames through which people understand situations and imagine possibilities.

**Tools & Processes** provide language, categories, and mental models:
- Organizations using Jira think in "stories," "epics," and "sprints"
- Organizations using Azure DevOps think in "work items," "boards," and "releases"
- Organizations using physical kanban think in "flow," "WIP limits," and "cycle time"

You can often detect which tools an organization uses before seeing them, simply by listening to how people talk about work. The tool hasn't just enabled certain workflows—it has shaped what concepts are available, what breakdowns feel natural, what people can easily visualize.

**Data & Feedback** shapes attention and what constitutes evidence:
- What's measured becomes salient; unmeasured phenomena fade from awareness
- Available metrics determine what questions can be answered
- Dashboards shape what comparisons feel natural
- "Data-driven" decisions are constrained by what data exists

**Capacity** shapes time horizons and perceived possibility:
- Chronic overload trains people to think short-term; long-horizon planning feels unrealistic
- Never experiencing slack time makes slack-dependent activities (reflection, exploration, relationship building) cognitively unavailable
- Authority boundaries shape what feels "within scope" vs. "not my domain"

**Skills & Knowledge** shapes problem recognition and solution space:
- If you don't know technique X exists, you can't recognize situations where X would help
- Training in particular methodologies shapes what problems are visible
- Professional socialization shapes what feels like "real work" vs. auxiliary activity

**Motivation & Values** shapes what opportunities are noticed:
- You see what you're primed to care about
- Reward structures shape what feels like "winning" vs. "losing"
- What's celebrated in stories shapes aspirational identity

**Why the cognitive mechanism matters:**

The cognitive function explains why changing structural domains can feel so disorienting. It's not just that new behaviors are required—**new ways of thinking become necessary.** When an organization switches from measuring "velocity" to measuring "cycle time," people must reconceptualize what constitutes progress. The language shifts, the mental models shift, and what feels like "doing well" shifts.

This is also why contradictory domains create confusion beyond simple mixed signals: they create **cognitive dissonance**. When leaders say "take time to innovate" (verbal message) but maintain 100% utilization (capacity allocation), people experience not just conflicting signals but conflicting frames. The time-scarcity frame makes innovation cognitively difficult to envision, even when verbally encouraged.

**The Three Mechanisms Work Together**

Structural domains exert influence through all three mechanisms simultaneously:

A capacity constraint (100% utilization) doesn't just prevent experimentation (structural) and signal that other work matters more (legitimacy)—it also shapes people to think short-term and makes long-horizon exploration cognitively unavailable (cognitive).

A tool choice (Jira vs. kanban) doesn't just enable certain workflows (structural) and signal priorities through investment (legitimacy)—it also provides the language and mental models through which work is understood (cognitive).

This triple mechanism explains why structural changes are so powerful: they don't just change what's possible and what's valued—they change what's thinkable.

**The Collective Interpretation Domain: A Different Mechanism**

**Norms & Expectations** operates fundamentally differently from the five structural domains. While structural domains are designed, allocated, and controlled by those with organizational authority, **Norms emerges from collective interpretation through social interaction.**

Norms & Expectations represents the social layer where peer-to-peer interpretation occurs:
- Stories people tell about what happened to colleagues
- Informal signals about what's socially acceptable
- Identity-based expectations ("what people like me do here")
- Informal sanctions and social belonging cues

**Norms functions recursively:**
1. **As observable input:** Peer signals, stories, identity markers that individuals encounter
2. **As emergent process:** Collective sense-making as people compare experiences
3. **As outcome:** The stabilized pattern of distributed memory when interpretations converge
4. **As input again:** That pattern becomes a condition newcomers encounter

**Unlike structural domains, Norms:**
- Is constituted through interaction, not provided by organizational design
- Emerges from collective interpretation; cannot be mandated
- Functions recursively as both input and outcome
- Represents legitimacy itself at the collective level, not just a signal

**Examples of normative phenomena that don't fit in structural domains:**

- "Remember what happened to Jamie when they questioned the timeline?" (story that teaches risk)
- "Everyone leaves at 7pm but nobody talks about it" (unspoken social norm)
- "Real engineers here solve problems, they don't raise problems" (identity-based expectation)
- "People who use all their vacation are seen as uncommitted" (informal sanction)

These exist only in social interaction. Organizations cannot design them directly, only influence them indirectly by shaping the structural domains from which normative patterns emerge.

**In institutional theory terms:** Norms & Expectations is where legitimacy ultimately resides. The five structural domains create conditions that influence whether legitimacy converges, but convergence happens at the collective level through normative alignment. When practices achieve "taken-for-granted" status (Meyer & Rowan, 1977; Zucker, 1977), that taken-for-grantedness lives in Norms & Expectations.

**Framework Foundations: Gilbert and Institutional Theory**

This framework draws on Gilbert's (1978) Behavior Engineering Model while extending it in three critical ways:

**First,** Gilbert distinguished between environmental support (information, instrumentation, motivation) and individual repertory (knowledge, capacity, motives). ICT recognizes that what Gilbert treated as "individual capacity" often reflects organizational capacity allocation—system-level decisions about time, authority, and resources.

**Second,** Gilbert focused on performance optimization ("what environmental supports enable worthy performance?"). ICT reframes environmental factors as signals and cognitive frames ("what environmental cues teach people what responses are legitimate and shape what's thinkable?").

**Third,** Gilbert's framework operated at the individual-organization interface. ICT adds the collective interpretation layer (Norms & Expectations), recognizing that legitimacy ultimately resides not in individual assessment but in collective, socially-negotiated sense of what's taken-for-granted. This addition connects performance engineering to institutional theory's core insight: practices become institutionalized when they achieve taken-for-granted status through collective enactment.

**Relationship to Organizational Learning Literature**

Interpretive Conditions Theory's concept of distributed memory shares surface similarity with organizational learning literature's concept of organizational memory (Walsh & Ungson, 1991; Levitt & March, 1988), but operates through different mechanisms and explains different phenomena.

**Where Organizational Learning and ICT Overlap:**

Both literatures recognize that:
- Organizations "remember" through distributed patterns across individuals, culture, transformations, structures, and ecology rather than central storage (Walsh & Ungson, 1991)
- Routines encode experience and guide future behavior (Levitt & March, 1988; Nelson & Winter, 1982)

**Where ICT Differs: Learning Legitimacy vs. Learning from Outcomes**

**Organizational learning literature primarily focuses on outcome-based learning:**
- Organizations try actions → observe results → encode lessons in routines (Levitt & March, 1988)
- Problemistic search is triggered by performance gaps (Cyert & March, 1963)
- Learning occurs through direct experience and observation of others' experience (Levitt & March, 1988)

**ICT focuses on cue-based learning about legitimacy:**
- People read environmental cues → infer what's safe/legitimate → respond accordingly
- Learning shapes what gets attempted, not just what gets retained after trial
- Patterns can persist despite poor performance when legitimacy cues remain consistent
- Change requires shifting cue patterns, not just demonstrating better performance

**Example distinguishing the mechanisms:**

**Organizational Learning explanation:** "We tried speaking up in meetings, it led to negative consequences, so we learned not to do it."

**ICT explanation:** "We observed cues across domains (people who spoke up were labeled difficult, didn't get promoted, meetings ran long) and inferred speaking up wasn't legitimate, so we never tried it in the first place."

**Key difference:** ICT explains learning that occurs **before action is attempted**, through interpretation of environmental cues about legitimacy rather than direct experience of outcomes.

**Where Empirical Organizational Learning Research Supports ICT:**

**1. Routines persist despite poor performance (supports contested equilibrium)**

Levitt & March (1988) document "competency traps"—organizations continue routines that are suboptimal because the familiarity of the routine makes it easier to improve incrementally than to switch to an unfamiliar routine that might ultimately yield better performance. This aligns with ICT's contested equilibrium: coordination tips (routine is enacted) but legitimacy may remain contested.

**2. Superstitious learning creates persistent patterns based on incorrect inference**

Organizations develop routines based on spurious correlations or incorrect causal inference (Levitt & March, 1988). Once encoded, these routines persist. ICT extends this by showing how such patterns persist through continuous enactment even when performance evidence contradicts them—because legitimacy cues across domains continue to support them.

**3. Knowledge doesn't transfer even when beneficial**

Szulanski (1996) found that knowledge transfer fails due to "stickiness"—barriers include causal ambiguity, arduous relationships, lack of absorptive capacity, and the unproven nature of knowledge. ICT suggests an additional mechanism: practices don't transfer because legitimacy cues in the recipient context signal they're inappropriate, regardless of demonstrated performance elsewhere.

**4. Organizational memory is distributed across multiple "bins"**

Walsh & Ungson (1991) show organizational memory resides in individuals, culture, transformations, structures, and ecology—no single repository holds "the memory." This directly supports ICT's distributed memory concept: everyone holds fragments, coordination emerges from overlapping experience.

**Where Empirical Organizational Learning Research Challenges ICT:**

**1. Performance feedback does drive change**

Cyert & March (1963) show organizations respond to performance gaps through problemistic search and adaptation. This appears to challenge ICT's emphasis on persistence despite poor performance.

**ICT's response:** Performance feedback matters, but primarily when legitimacy cues also shift. When performance is poor BUT legitimacy cues remain consistent (e.g., "this is still what credible organizations do," "leadership still advocates this," "peers still enact it"), patterns persist. Performance feedback alone is often insufficient without legitimacy cue shifts.

**2. Organizations can unlearn and abandon routines**

Research shows organizations do sometimes abandon established routines when they demonstrably fail, though Hedberg (1981) notes unlearning is difficult and requires active effort. This challenges ICT's emphasis on persistence.

**ICT's response:** Unlearning occurs, but typically requires disruption across multiple domains simultaneously—not just performance evidence. Leadership change, tool changes, restructuring, and crisis can shift legitimacy cues across domains, enabling new patterns. ICT predicts unlearning is difficult precisely because it requires coordinated domain shifts, not just performance data.

**3. Absorptive capacity enables learning from external knowledge**

Cohen & Levinthal (1990) show organizations with prior related knowledge can recognize, assimilate, and apply new external knowledge. This suggests learning isn't purely path-dependent—organizations can break from existing patterns when they have capacity.

**ICT's response:** Absorptive capacity is necessary but not sufficient. Organizations may have the capacity to understand a new practice (skills/knowledge domain) but still not adopt it if other domains signal illegitimacy. Capacity enables interpretation but doesn't determine legitimacy convergence.

**Complementary, Not Competing Frameworks**

Organizational learning and ICT are complementary frameworks operating at different analytic levels and answering different questions:

**Organizational Learning asks:**
- How do organizations learn from experience?
- How is knowledge created, transferred, and retained?
- What triggers search and adaptation?

**ICT asks:**
- How do people learn what's legitimate before trying?
- Why do patterns persist when they don't improve performance?
- How can coordination occur without acceptance (contested equilibrium)?

**Integration point:** 

Organizational learning explains how routines encode lessons from trial-and-error (Levitt & March, 1988). ICT explains:
1. What determines which trials get attempted (cue-based legitimacy learning)
2. Why some routines persist as contested equilibrium (coordination without legitimacy)
3. How legitimacy shapes which performance feedback gets attended to

**Example integration:**

A team learns through trial that a particular workflow improves quality. But if legitimacy cues signal this workflow isn't "how people like us work here," adoption may fail despite demonstrated performance gains. Conversely, a practice may be widely enacted because legitimacy cues align even though performance feedback shows it's ineffective (creating the competency traps that Levitt & March document).

The frameworks illuminate different mechanisms within the same empirical phenomena.

**Domain Alignment and Legitimacy Convergence**

**These domains represent analytically distinct categories of environmental and social cues through which legitimacy is signaled and learned.**

When people decide "Is this action legitimate here, and is it possible?", they're triangulating across multiple types of cues:

**Structural signals:**
* **Data & Feedback:** Will this show up in my review? Does anyone track it?
* **Tools & Processes:** Do systems support it? Can I even do this with our tools? What does the tool make me think about?
* **Capacity:** Do I have time? Am I authorized? Does capacity allocation signal this matters?
* **Skills & Knowledge:** Do I know how? Has the organization invested in teaching this?
* **Motivation & Values:** Is it connected to advancement, bonuses, recognition?

**Collective interpretation:**
* **Norms & Expectations:** Do people like me do this? What stories circulate? What does this mean for my identity/belonging?

**When structural domains align—cues across all five point consistently in the same direction—AND when normative signals converge, legitimacy reaches taken-for-granted status:**

"Yes, this is obviously what we do here. All signals confirm it, it's structurally possible, I can think about it clearly, and everyone like me does it."

**When structural domains align BUT norms resist:**

"The organization supports this structurally, but peers signal it's not what people like me do here."

**When structural domains contradict each other:**

"Leaders say they want X, but measurement, tools, capacity allocation, training investment, and rewards all contradict this. I can't even think clearly about what X would look like in practice."

**When capacity constrains despite other structural alignment:**

"This would be legitimate if possible, but there's no time/authority—AND the tolerance of this impossibility signals it's not actually legitimate despite verbal claims."

**Practical Application: Auditing All Six Domains**

For any change initiative, audit across two levels:

**Structural level (can leadership directly change?):**
* **Data & Feedback:** Does measurement reinforce the practice? What signals does tracking send?
* **Tools & Processes:** Do systems enable it? What language/concepts do tools provide?
* **Capacity:** Is time/authority available? What does allocation signal?
* **Skills & Knowledge:** Is training provided? What expertise is developed?
* **Motivation & Values:** Is it connected to advancement and recognition?

**Collective level (can only influence indirectly):**
* **Norms & Expectations:** What stories circulate? What do peers signal? What happens to early adopters?

**Common diagnostic patterns:**

**Pattern 1: Structural contradiction**
- Domains send conflicting signals
- Result: Confusion, scattered attempts, no pattern formation
- Intervention: Align structural cues

**Pattern 2: Capacity-constrained**
- Other structural domains align positively
- But persistent capacity constraints block action
- Tolerance of constraints signals true priorities
- Result: High verbal support, zero behavior, misdiagnosed as motivation problem
- Intervention: Create actual capacity AND address what tolerance signals

**Pattern 3: Normative resistance**
- Structural domains align
- But peer signals, stories, identity markers contradict
- Result: Scattered adoption by "non-conformists," majority resistance
- Intervention: Influence normative layer through visible early adopter protection, new stories

**Pattern 4: Cognitive mismatch**
- Tools/metrics provide frames incompatible with desired practice
- Result: People can't think clearly about what's being asked
- Intervention: Change tools/metrics to enable appropriate conceptualization

**Domain Weighting and Interaction: Theoretical Propositions**

The relative influence of each domain on legitimacy convergence and coordination stability is an empirical question requiring further investigation. However, theoretical and empirical foundations suggest several testable propositions:

**Proposition 1: Environmental support domains exert stronger influence on coordination stability than individual repertory domains.**

Gilbert's (1978) finding that environmental factors account for approximately 75% of performance variance suggests that Data & Feedback, Tools & Processes, and Capacity may have disproportionate influence on whether practices become behaviorally enacted. These domains directly constrain or enable action through structural mechanisms.

**Proposition 2: Norms & Expectations exerts the strongest influence on legitimacy convergence.**

Institutional theory's emphasis on taken-for-grantedness as the marker of full institutionalization (Tolbert & Zucker, 1996) suggests that collective interpretation—what becomes "normal"—may be the primary driver of whether practices move from contested to routine to taken-for-granted legitimacy.

**Proposition 3: Different domains weight differently for coordination versus legitimacy.**

Because coordination stability and legitimacy convergence can decouple (producing contested equilibrium), domains may have differential effects:

- **Coordination-dominant domains:** Tools & Processes (hard dependencies), Data & Feedback (monitoring), Capacity (structural enablement)
- **Legitimacy-dominant domains:** Norms & Expectations (collective meaning), Motivation & Values (worthwhileness), Skills & Knowledge (confidence/mastery)

This suggests that:
- Practices can achieve coordination stability through consistency in coordination-dominant domains even when legitimacy-dominant domains remain contradictory
- Practices can have high legitimacy in principle (consistency in legitimacy-dominant domains) while failing to achieve behavioral enactment (misalignment in coordination-dominant domains)

**Proposition 4: Capacity acts as a gating condition for coordination.**

When Capacity constraints are severe (e.g., zero available time, absolute authority prohibition), consistency across all other domains cannot produce behavioral enactment. However, Capacity consistency alone cannot produce sustained practice without support from other domains. This suggests Capacity may function as a necessary-but-not-sufficient condition rather than an additive factor.

**Proposition 5: Minimum threshold for legitimacy convergence requires consistency in at least four domains, including Norms & Expectations.**

Based on institutional theory's emphasis on taken-for-grantedness and Gilbert's environmental focus, legitimacy convergence likely requires:
- Norms & Expectations consistency (necessary)
- Plus consistency in at least three additional domains (sufficient when combined with Norms)

This proposition is testable through comparative case analysis of practices that achieved legitimacy convergence versus those that stabilized as contested equilibrium.

**Empirical Validation Requirements**

These propositions require systematic empirical investigation through:
1. **Comparative case studies** examining domain consistency patterns in cases of legitimacy convergence vs. contested equilibrium
2. **Longitudinal process studies** tracking how practices evolve as domain consistency shifts
3. **Quantitative analysis** coding domain consistency across multiple organizations and measuring time-to-legitimacy-convergence
4. **Experimental interventions** manipulating specific domains while holding others constant

The six-domain framework provides diagnostic utility even without precise weighting, as contradictions between domains—regardless of relative weight—signal contested legitimacy. However, specifying domain weights and interaction effects would significantly enhance predictive power and intervention targeting.

**Future Theoretical Development**

Critical questions requiring further specification include:

1. **Substitutability:** Can strong consistency in some domains compensate for weak consistency in others? Or are certain domains non-substitutable prerequisites?

2. **Sequencing:** Must domains align in a particular order? Does early consistency in certain domains make later consistency in others easier or harder?

3. **Context dependence:** Do domain weights vary by organizational context (e.g., highly regulated vs. entrepreneurial), practice type (e.g., technical vs. cultural), or adoption stage (e.g., early vs. late)?

4. **Threshold vs. gradient:** Is legitimacy convergence a discrete threshold (tips when N domains align) or a gradient (gradually strengthens with each additional domain)?

5. **Decay patterns:** When aligned domains fall out of alignment, which losses have the strongest effect on legitimacy dissolution?

These questions represent the theory's current boundaries and opportunities for empirical extension.

### Cues

**Cues are the observable signals people read from domains to infer legitimacy.**

Cues include:

* Leadership attention (what leaders spend time on, ask about, ignore)
* Patterns of reward and punishment (who gets promoted, who gets sidelined)
* Silence around certain topics (what can't be discussed)
* Consistency—or inconsistency—between words and actions
* What gets measured and reviewed
* Who gets resources and support
* How mistakes are treated
* What's celebrated in stories and rituals
* Time allocation (what people actually have capacity for)
* Authority boundaries (who can make which decisions)

**Cues often operate implicitly.** People may not be able to name them, but they reliably shape behavior by signaling what is safe or dangerous to attempt.

**The power of cues lies in their consistency across domains.** A single cue might be ambiguous, but when multiple cues across multiple domains consistently point in the same direction, they create coherent signals about legitimacy.

### Interpretation and Response

**Interpretation** refers to the sensemaking process through which individuals assign meaning to cues.

**Response** is the action that follows.

Importantly, responses are often adaptive rather than intentional. People act in ways that align with what the system appears to reward or tolerate, even when those responses contradict stated values or official policy.

**This is not deception or bad faith.** It's rational navigation of the cue environment.

When someone says "we value innovation" but every cue signals "don't make mistakes," responding with caution is the sensible interpretation of conditions, not resistance to change.

### Structures as Pattern Continuously Recreated

In Interpretive Conditions Theory, **structures are not charts, plans, or designs. They are stabilized patterns of response that persist through continuous reenactment.**

When certain responses repeatedly lead to reward or safety, they become normalized. When responses lead to risk or punishment, they are avoided. Over time, the system "learns" these patterns through distributed individual experience, and future behavior is shaped by this collective learning—even when original conditions have changed.

Structures form not only through signals of legitimacy and risk, but also through repeated adaptation to constraint—such as workarounds, delays, or avoidance shaped by tool limits, authority boundaries, or resource restrictions.

**Structures thus function as organizational memory—but not as information stored somewhere.**

When we say a structure "remembers," we mean: people have collectively learned, through overlapping experience, what responses are legitimate or viable. This learning guides behavior without requiring constant enforcement.

**Example: The vacation structure**

In many workplaces, official policies say employees are encouraged to take time off, or even that vacation is unlimited. Yet people quickly learn how much vacation is actually acceptable by:

* Watching who takes time off
* Observing how it's discussed
* Noticing whether there are consequences afterward
* Seeing what happens during busy periods
* Hearing stories about people who "took too much"

Over time, employees "just know" how much absence is safe, regardless of what the policy states.

**This "knowing" only exists because people keep enacting the pattern:**

* People take "safe" amounts of vacation
* Managers approve those amounts without comment
* Taking more triggers subtle or explicit consequences
* Stories circulate reinforcing the pattern
* New employees observe and learn the same limits

If everyone started taking unlimited vacation tomorrow and nothing bad happened, the structure would dissolve. It persists only through continuous reproduction.

**Key implication: Structures are fragile in ways we don't typically recognize.**

They feel solid and enduring, but they exist only in ongoing enactment. When conditions shift enough that coordinated enactment shifts, even deeply learned structures can change rapidly.

Conversely, structures can persist long after formal conditions change, because people continue enacting learned patterns until new coordinated responses emerge.

---

## Explaining Stability

The theory explains organizational stability as a consequence of learned interpretation, not resistance to change.

**Patterns persist because people keep finding them sensible, safe, or necessary—not because the patterns are stored somewhere preventing change.**

Consider a team that once experienced negative consequences for raising concerns. Members learned: "speaking up here is risky." Even after leadership changes, people may remain silent. No one needs to enforce silence; the structure has already formed through distributed learning. The system continues to respond to what it has learned about risk.

Each person holds a fragment of this memory:

* "I saw what happened to Jamie when they questioned the approach"
* "My first week, someone warned me to keep my head down"
* "In my review, I was told I wasn't a 'team player' after I raised an issue"
* "Meetings end quickly when no one disagrees"

When these fragments overlap enough, they create coordinated enactment: everyone stays silent. The pattern feels real and shared, even though it exists nowhere except in the continuous reproduction of silent responses.

**This explains why:**

* Change initiatives revert under pressure (old patterns feel safer)
* Training fails to translate into practice (learned conditions override training)
* "We tried that once" continues to carry weight (that attempt is part of the memory)
* New leaders inherit patterns they didn't create (because everyone else still enacts them)

**Stability is not stubbornness; it is memory continuously enacted.**

---

## Explaining Change

Change occurs when conditions shift sufficiently that different responses become legitimate—and when enough people begin enacting those different responses that a new coordinated pattern emerges.

**This may involve:**

* Altering feedback loops (change what gets measured, discussed, rewarded)
* Redistributing decision authority (change who can make which choices)
* Changing what is visible or invisible (transparency or opacity around different information)
* Redefining success and failure (change what counts as "good" performance)
* Reducing or redistributing risk (make new responses safer through protection, support, or collective action)
* Aligning cues across domains (ensure all six domains signal the new pattern consistently)
* **Creating capacity** (making time available, expanding authority, removing competing demands, addressing structural barriers)

**Critical insight: Change requires both condition shifts AND coordinated enactment of new responses.**

Changing conditions alone isn't sufficient if people don't enact different responses. And people enacting different responses isn't sustainable if conditions still punish those responses.

**Change stabilizes when:**

1. Conditions shift to make new responses legitimate
2. Enough people enact the new response that it becomes coordinated
3. The new pattern gets repeated enough that it becomes learned
4. Distributed memory now encodes the new pattern as "how we do things"

**Interpretive Conditions Theory does not promise predictable outcomes.** People may still respond in unexpected ways. However, it asserts that without meaningful condition change, new behavior often fails to persist—especially once attention, novelty, or pressure fades.

**Two types of change failure:**

**Type 1: Conditions don't actually change**

* Leaders announce new values but cues across domains still reinforce old patterns
* Result: Brief compliance followed by reversion

**Type 2: Coordination doesn't emerge**

* Conditions shift but people don't enact new responses at sufficient scale/consistency
* Result: Scattered adoption, no pattern formation, eventual abandonment

Successful change requires both.

## The Coordination-Legitimacy Distinction

A critical refinement in Interpretive Conditions Theory distinguishes between two types of "tipping points" that are often conflated:

### The Coordination Tipping Point (Behavioral Convergence)

**People comply because the practice becomes the cheapest way to coordinate:**

* Tools/processes become mandatory to get work done
* Dependencies assume participation
* Opt-out becomes costly (friction, delays, exclusion from information/decisions)

This can happen **without legitimacy.** It's "I do it because I have to" or "because everything else now depends on it."

### The Legitimacy Tipping Point (Interpretive Convergence)

**People comply because the practice becomes taken-for-granted as sensible/appropriate:**

* "This is how we do things"
* Dissent becomes socially weird, not just inconvenient
* People defend the practice even when it disadvantages them

This is what institutional theory often assumes eventually happens through repeated enactment (sedimentation leading to taken-for-grantedness).

### The Key ICT Insight: These Can Decouple

**Coordination can tip while legitimacy remains contested.**

This produces **contested equilibrium**—a stable state in which:

* Practices are routinely enacted (behavioral stability)
* But legitimacy never converges (interpretive resistance persists)

**This is not incomplete institutionalization or failed change. It's a predictable attractor when:**

* Enforcement mechanisms sustain behavior (monitoring, dependencies, consequences)
* BUT the interpretive environment continues generating cues of illegitimacy (unfairness, hypocrisy, misalignment across subunits)

**Examples:**

* Open office plans: Widely adopted, persistently hated
* Performance reviews: Required everywhere, trusted nowhere
* Return-to-office mandates: Enforced compliance, ongoing legitimacy conflict
* Compliance training: Everyone does it, no one thinks it works

These contemporary examples echo patterns documented in studies of management practice diffusion. Westphal, Gulati, and Shortell (1997) found that organizations widely adopted Total Quality Management to gain institutional legitimacy while varying dramatically in whether they customized practices to address substantive organizational needs, with many implementing TQM symbolically to conform to field-level expectations. The persistence of such patterns across diverse management practices—from TQM in the 1990s to return-to-office mandates today—suggests that contested equilibrium may be a common outcome when practices diffuse through institutional pressures (coercive, mimetic, or normative) rather than through demonstrated local efficacy.

**Why this matters:**

Most organizational theory assumes behavioral stability implies legitimacy ("if people keep doing it, they must accept it"). ICT shows this is false.

Research on organizational practice adoption provides empirical support for this distinction. Westphal, Gulati, and Shortell (1997) demonstrated that organizations adopt Total Quality Management practices to conform to institutional pressures (achieving behavioral adoption and external legitimacy) while varying widely in whether they customize those practices substantively to fit local technical needs. Early adopters were more likely to customize TQM to address specific organizational problems, while later adopters conformed to gain legitimacy with minimal customization. This pattern—widespread behavioral adoption masking variation in substantive implementation—illustrates how coordination can tip (everyone adopts) while legitimacy remains contested (few internalize). ICT extends this insight by positioning contested equilibrium not as a transitional state on the path to full institutionalization, but as a predictable and potentially durable organizational condition when enforcement mechanisms sustain coordination while cue environments prevent interpretive convergence.

**Practices can become structurally remembered as routines of compliance before—and even without—becoming legitimate as shared meaning.**

People learn "this is required" without ever learning "this makes sense." The structure that forms encodes "how to survive this," not "this is right."

Research on organizational compliance programs illustrates this dynamic: organizations achieve high behavioral conformity while internal legitimacy remains absent, creating what MacLean and Behnam (2010) term a "legitimacy facade"—external perceptions of legitimacy masking internal illegitimacy and enabling continued dysfunction.

**Measurement implication:**

Compliance metrics (adoption rates, usage statistics, behavioral observations) are insufficient evidence of successful change. They measure coordination, not legitimacy.

Research on practice diffusion demonstrates why: measuring whether organizations have adopted a practice reveals nothing about whether they have implemented it substantively or adopted it symbolically for legitimacy (Westphal et al., 1997). Organizations widely adopted TQM while varying dramatically in the depth and customization of implementation, with symbolic adopters achieving external legitimacy without internal transformation. Similarly, ICT predicts that high adoption rates can coexist with persistent internal illegitimacy.

To assess legitimacy, you need to examine discourse: How do people talk about the practice? Do they justify it or just comply? Do they defend it or work around it? Do they adapt it to local needs or implement it formulaically? The content and depth of adoption matters as much as the fact of adoption.

**Intervention implication:**

If you're observing contested equilibrium (high compliance + persistent resistance), adding more enforcement won't resolve legitimacy. You need to address the contradictory cues across domains that prevent interpretive convergence.

## Scope and Limitations

Interpretive Conditions Theory applies best to persistent patterns of behavior in human systems where interpretation, legitimacy, and learning operate over time.

### When ICT Applies

**ICT is designed to explain within-organization dynamics:**

* How patterns form, persist, and change within a single organizational context
* How legitimacy is learned through interpretation of conditions
* How distributed memory emerges through coordinated enactment
* Why behavioral compliance can occur without interpretive convergence
* How practices can stabilize as contested equilibrium

**The theory works when:**

* **Interpretation is possible** – Actors have cognitive capacity to read cues and assess legitimacy
* **Choice exists** – Some meaningful range of response options, even if constrained
* **Consequences are observable** – People can learn from what happens when actions are taken
* **Coordination matters** – Patterns require some alignment across actors
* **Time for learning** – Repeated interactions allow distributed memory to form through overlapping experience

### What ICT Does Not Explain

**ICT deliberately does not attempt to explain:**

* **Field-level diffusion** of practices across organizations (how "best practices" spread industry-wide)
* **Industry-wide isomorphism** or convergence (why organizations come to look alike)
* **Societal-level institutionalization** (how practices become taken-for-granted across entire societies)
* **Purely physical impossibility** or non-negotiable material constraint unrelated to social organization
* **Momentary compliance under first-contact coercion** (initial forced behavior before any learning occurs)
* **Behavior in total institutions** with continuous surveillance where interpretation becomes irrelevant
* **The psychological origins of radical novelty** or creativity (where entirely new patterns come from)
* **Non-social or purely mechanical systems** (machines, algorithms, physical processes)

### The Relationship Between ICT and Field-Level Institutional Theory

Field-level phenomena—such as industry-wide adoption of practices, regulatory requirements, or professional norms—involve the same interpretive and constraint mechanisms ICT describes, but operating at a different level of analysis.

**Within organizations,** regulatory requirements, professional norms, and competitor practices function as conditions (constraints and cues) that people interpret and respond to. ICT explains how these external conditions—along with internal ones—shape legitimacy interpretation and coordinated enactment.

**Across organizations (field-level),** ICT does not explain how these conditions themselves emerge, diffuse, or become widespread. Field-level institutional analysis examines diffusion across organizational fields—"those organizations that, in the aggregate, constitute a recognized area of institutional life" (DiMaggio & Powell, 1983, p. 148)—including industry-wide isomorphism and inter-organizational mimicry. Why do certain regulatory requirements get adopted? How do professional norms form and spread across a profession? Why do industries converge on similar practices? These questions involve field-level dynamics (industry evolution, institutional entrepreneurship, political coalition-building) that ICT treats as background conditions rather than phenomena to be explained.

**ICT's contribution is explaining what happens inside organizations when these external and internal conditions are present**—how they're interpreted, how responses coordinate into patterns, and why those patterns persist or change through continuous enactment.

For example, when a new regulatory requirement is introduced:

* Field-level institutional theory explains how that requirement emerged and spread across organizations
* ICT explains how people within a specific organization interpret that requirement, what legitimacy they assign to compliance, how they coordinate responses, and whether the practice stabilizes as genuinely legitimate or as contested equilibrium

Both levels of analysis are valuable; ICT is deliberately scoped to the within-organization level.

### Boundary Cases Requiring Further Development

Some contexts fall at the boundaries of ICT's scope and require additional theoretical specification:

**Crisis situations:** Does legitimacy interpretation change under extreme time pressure? Do people revert to deeply learned patterns or break from them? How does interpretive space function when decisions must be immediate?

**Radical uncertainty:** When cues are completely novel (unprecedented technology, situations with no historical parallel), how does interpretation work without distributed memory to draw upon?

**Cross-cultural contexts:** Do the six domains operate universally, or are some culture-specific? How does legitimacy interpretation vary across national/cultural boundaries within multinational organizations?

**Extreme power asymmetries:** At what level of power concentration does interpretation become largely irrelevant? When does coercion fully substitute for legitimacy-based coordination?

**Hybrid/remote organizations:** How does distributed work (remote, asynchronous) affect cue visibility and distributed memory formation? Does physical co-location matter for pattern coordination?

These boundary cases represent opportunities for theoretical extension rather than limitations of the core framework.

### What ICT Is and Is Not

**ICT is:**

* A **diagnostic theory** explaining why patterns persist and where influence accumulates
* A **process theory** focused on continuous enactment rather than static structures
* A **within-organization theory** deliberately scoped to local coordination dynamics
* An **interpretive theory** that explains pattern formation through meaning-making

**ICT is not:**

* A **predictive theory** that guarantees specific outcomes from interventions
* A **prescriptive theory** that specifies optimal organizational designs
* A **comprehensive theory** attempting to explain all organizational phenomena
* A **deterministic theory** treating behavior as mechanically produced by conditions

The theory's value lies not in prediction or prescription, but in making visible the mechanisms through which persistent patterns emerge and are maintained—or how they might be changed—through the ongoing relationship between conditions, interpretation, and coordinated action.

## Strengths

**Integrates interpretation, legitimacy, constraint, and structural memory into a coherent recursive account of persistence.**

Clarifies how meaning, legitimacy, and repeated responses recursively produce stability without relying on linear cause-effect models.

**Explains persistence and resistance to change without blaming individuals or assuming bad faith.**

Shifts explanation from motivation or intent to the conditions that shape what actions feel legitimate, safe, or sensible.

**Accounts for why change efforts fail when legitimacy and capacity are misaligned.**

Shows how interventions stall or backfire when new expectations conflict with existing interpretive conditions and system memory.

**Provides a meso- and micro-level operationalization of institutional persistence.**

Extends core insights from Institutional Theory to teams and organizations by specifying how legitimacy is enacted, remembered, and reproduced through local patterns of coordinated action.

**Distinguishes coordination from legitimacy, explaining contested equilibrium.**

Shows how practices can stabilize behaviorally while remaining interpretively contested—a phenomenon existing theory treats as semi-institutionalization (Tolbert & Zucker, 1996) requiring progression toward taken-for-grantedness, rather than as a stable state.

**Makes processual ontology accessible.**

Adopts structure-as-process thinking from Structuration Theory (Giddens, 1984) while retaining structure-as-noun language that practitioners need for communication.

## Critiques and Questions

Critics may argue that Interpretive Conditions Theory under-specifies the mechanics of power, enforcement, and strategic action, particularly in contexts where authority is highly centralized or coercive.

Others may question whether the theory can account for moments of rapid change driven by legal rulings, political realignments, or technological disruption.

**Interpretive Conditions Theory responds that it is not a theory of power acquisition, institutional engineering, or individual motivation.**

Instead, it explains how legitimacy and constraint shape collective response over time, and how repeated responses stabilize into pattern through continuous coordinated enactment.

The theory is most useful for understanding persistence, resistance, backlash, and fragmentation in human systems, and invites empirical testing in contexts where legitimacy and capacity appear misaligned or where structural memory fails to predict behavior.

**On power:**

ICT acknowledges that some actors have greater capacity to shape conditions others respond to (what the theory calls "stewardship of conditions"). However, even powerful actors cannot simply impose legitimacy—they can enforce compliance, but interpretive convergence requires cue consistency across domains.

Power matters most in determining:

* What gets monitored and enforced (affecting coordination tipping points)
* What becomes visible or invisible (affecting cue availability)
* Whose interpretations get amplified or suppressed (affecting coordination around which pattern)

But power cannot directly create taken-for-grantedness. That requires coordinated enactment and distributed learning over time.

---

## Why This Theory Matters

Interpretive Conditions Theory offers a way to understand organizing by explaining how people in systems respond to the conditions around them, independent of intent or plan.

It integrates communication theory, institutional theory, and process thinking to show how legitimacy and constraint shape collective response over time, and how those responses stabilize into pattern through continuous coordinated enactment.

Rather than asking leaders to control behavior or change mindsets, the theory reframes the problem. It asks a simpler, harder question:

> **What is this system teaching people to do—and what is it making possible or impossible?**

That question—more than any directive—explains why patterns persist, why change efforts stall or backfire, and how organizing unfolds over time.

**For practitioners:**

ICT provides a diagnostic framework for understanding why change isn't happening:

* Are conditions actually different, or just the words?
* Do cues across all six domains align, or are they contradictory?
* Has coordination tipped but legitimacy remained contested?
* Are people learning "how to survive this" rather than "this makes sense"?
* Is the real barrier capacity (time, authority, competing demands)?

**For researchers:**

ICT offers testable propositions about when legitimacy converges versus remains contested, when behavioral stability indicates taken-for-grantedness versus contested equilibrium, and how distributed learning through coordinated enactment produces structural persistence.

## Contributions

Interpretive Conditions Theory contributes a legitimacy-centered, processual account of persistence in human systems by foregrounding how stabilized patterns of response function as organizational memory formed through continuous coordinated enactment in response to interpreted conditions.

This framing helps explain why patterns stabilize, resist change, and recur over time—even after leadership changes, new strategies, or shifts in intent.

**Key theoretical contributions:**

**1. Distinguishes coordination from legitimacy**

Shows that behavioral stability can occur without interpretive convergence, producing contested equilibrium as a stable organizational state.

**2. Specifies structure as continuous enactment**

Treats structures not as entities that persist independently, but as patterns that exist only through ongoing reproduction by distributed actors with overlapping learned responses.

**3. Integrates and operationalizes the legitimacy-interpretation-memory loop**

While institutional theory foregrounds legitimacy in organizational conformity (Meyer & Rowan, 1977; DiMaggio & Powell, 1983), practice diffusion research demonstrates that behavioral adoption can occur without substantive implementation (Westphal et al., 1997), structuration theory conceptualizes memory traces, interpretive schemas, and legitimation as interconnected dimensions of structure (Giddens, 1984), sensemaking emphasizes interpretation and retrospection (Weick, 1995), and performance engineering identifies environmental support systems as primary drivers of behavior (Gilbert, 1978), ICT integrates these mechanisms and operationalizes how they function recursively at the micro level by specifying: (1) how legitimacy is signaled through consistent cues across environmental domains (adapting Gilbert's framework), (2) how interpretation occurs through reading these cue patterns, and (3) how distributed memory forms through overlapping learned responses. This integration explains not only why practices are adopted (institutional pressures) but how they persist—or fail to persist—through continuous within-organization enactment.

**4. Explains non-deterministic persistence**

Shows how patterns can persist through agency rather than despite it—people keep choosing responses that recreate the pattern because conditions make those responses sensible.

**5. Positions contested equilibrium as predictable, not pathological**

Challenges the assumption that organizational patterns must eventually become taken-for-granted. Institutional theory's dominant process model treats institutionalization as progression through habituation, objectification, and sedimentation, where full institutionalization requires practices to become taken-for-granted (Tolbert & Zucker, 1996). Practices that persist without achieving this final stage are framed as semi-institutionalized—incomplete rather than stable. ICT demonstrates when and why legitimacy remains durably contested even as behavioral compliance stabilizes.

**6. Specifies how structural domains shape patterns through three mechanisms**

Extends Gilbert's (1978) environmental focus by showing that structural domains don't just enable/constrain action and signal priorities—they also shape cognition by providing the interpretive frames, language, and mental models through which people understand situations and imagine possibilities. This triple mechanism explains why structural changes are so powerful and why contradictory domains create cognitive dissonance beyond simple mixed signals.

**7. Distinguishes cue-based learning from outcome-based learning**

While organizational learning literature focuses on how organizations encode lessons from trial-and-error (Levitt & March, 1988), ICT explains how people learn what's legitimate before attempting action, through interpretation of environmental cues across domains. This explains why some practices never get tried despite potential benefits, and why others persist despite poor performance—legitimacy learning operates independently of outcome learning.

By explicitly linking legitimacy, interpretation, agency, and constraint in a recursive model of persistence through coordinated enactment, the theory clarifies how everyday responses accumulate into durable patterns without requiring continuous enforcement or assuming individual-level bad faith.

It offers a non-deterministic account of leadership responsibility oriented toward shaping conditions that influence what actions become legitimate and sustainable in lived practice.

**Its primary contribution is integrating mechanisms identified separately across institutional theory, structuration theory, sensemaking, performance engineering, and organizational learning into a coherent, operationalizable framework for understanding within-organization persistence through continuous enactment.**

## Theory Comparison

*Interpretive Conditions Theory synthesizes and reorders core mechanisms from Institutional Theory, Structuration Theory, and process organization studies to foreground how interpretation, legitimacy, and memory jointly shape persistent patterns of action in human systems through continuous coordinated enactment, and to illuminate where changes in lived action are likely—or unlikely—to endure.*

| Theory | Primary focus | How behavior is explained | View of structure | View of change | What it explains well | Common limits / where it's less explicit |

| **Interpretive Conditions Theory (ICT)** | Persistence and change in patterned behavior via *interpretation of conditions* and *legitimacy cues*, with stabilization through continuous coordinated enactment. | People respond to what the environment makes seem safe/expected/worthwhile (via consistent cues across six domains). Repeated coordinated responses create patterns that persist only through ongoing reenactment. | "Structures" are patterns continuously recreated through coordinated action; they exist as distributed memory, not stored objects. | Change persists when conditions shift enough that different responses become legitimate/possible AND enough people enact the new response that coordination emerges; declarations alone are insufficient. | Why patterns persist after intentions change; why initiatives revert; how risk-avoidance, silence, and workarounds become "normal"; why compliance ≠ legitimacy; why capacity constraints block change; how tools shape cognition. | Deliberately focused on within-org dynamics; doesn't explain field-level diffusion; under-specifies some power mechanisms; requires qualitative methods to assess legitimacy vs. just measuring compliance. |
| **Structuration Theory (Giddens, 1984)** | Reciprocal constitution of agency and structure (duality). | Action draws on rules/resources and, through repetition, reproduces or alters those same structures. | Structure is both medium and outcome of practice (enabling and constraining). | Change occurs when ongoing practices shift; reproduction and transformation are continuous possibilities. | How everyday practices reproduce social systems; how constraint and enablement are intertwined; recursiveness of structure-action. | High level of abstraction; often offers limited operational guidance for measurement/diagnosis without additional applied frameworks. ICT operationalizes structuration insights. |
| **Neo-Institutional Theory (Meyer & Rowan, 1977; DiMaggio & Powell, 1983)** | Legitimacy, diffusion, and institutionalization within organizational fields (regulative/normative/cognitive pressures). | Organizations adopt and maintain practices partly to secure legitimacy under field pressures; decoupling can occur between formal structures and practice. | Institutions/fields shape what forms are legitimate; organizational structures may be symbolic, substantive, or both. | Change occurs as field-level logics, standards, regulations, or legitimacy criteria shift; also via entrepreneurship, shocks, and contestation. | Convergence/isomorphism, diffusion, decoupling; why "rationalized" forms spread across orgs; field-level dynamics. | Often stronger at field/macro explanation than micro-process accounts of day-to-day enactment. ICT specifies within-org mechanisms of how legitimacy is learned and enacted. |
| **Practice Diffusion & Adoption Studies (Westphal et al., 1997)** | How practices spread across organizations; symbolic vs. substantive adoption | Organizations adopt practices in response to institutional pressures (legitimacy-seeking) and/or technical needs (problem-solving). Adoption varies from symbolic conformity to deep customization. | Adopted practices as organizational features that may be coupled or decoupled from core operations depending on adoption motivations. | Practices diffuse through fields via mimicry, coercion, or normative pressure; early adopters customize more; late adopters conform more. | Inter-organizational variation in adoption timing, depth, and customization; why practices spread despite uncertain efficacy; symbolic vs. substantive implementation. | Focused on adoption decisions and initial implementation; less emphasis on long-term persistence mechanisms or within-org micro-processes of enactment. ICT specifies how adopted practices persist (or fail to persist) through continuous coordinated enactment and distributed learning. |
| **Behavior Engineering Model (Gilbert, 1978)** | Environmental support for performance; identifying barriers to worthy performance | Performance is primarily constrained by environmental factors: information, tools, capacity, knowledge, and motivation. Environmental factors (75%) outweigh individual factors (25%). | Formal organizational systems (information systems, resource allocation, incentive structures) that support or hinder performance. | Change occurs by fixing environmental deficiencies: improving data/feedback, providing adequate tools/resources, or aligning incentives. | Why capable, willing people underperform; where to intervene for performance improvement; cost-effectiveness of environmental vs. individual interventions; why training alone fails. | Assumes fixing environmental deficiencies produces behavior change; doesn't address legitimacy interpretation, collective pattern formation, cognitive framing, or why practices persist when environmental support is adequate. ICT extends by: (1) reframing environmental factors as legitimacy signals requiring consistency across domains, (2) adding Norms as collective interpretive layer, (3) showing how domains shape cognition and what's thinkable. |
| **Organizational Learning (Levitt & March, 1988; Cyert & March, 1963; Walsh & Ungson, 1991)** | How organizations learn from experience and encode knowledge in routines; organizational memory | Organizations try actions, observe outcomes, encode lessons in routines. Learning occurs through direct experience, vicarious observation, and search triggered by performance gaps. Memory is distributed across individuals, culture, structures. | Routines as encoded organizational memory; structures as repositories of learned responses to past situations. | Change triggered by performance gaps (problemistic search); learning enables adaptation, though competency traps and superstitious learning can sustain suboptimal routines. | Competency traps, superstitious learning, why routines persist; knowledge transfer difficulties; learning curves and performance improvement; problemistic search triggered by performance gaps; distributed nature of organizational memory. | Focuses on outcome-based learning (try → observe results → encode); assumes learning improves adaptation; doesn't distinguish coordination from legitimacy or explain why high-performing practices fail to be attempted when legitimacy cues signal they're inappropriate. ICT explains: (1) cue-based learning about legitimacy before action is attempted, (2) why patterns persist despite poor performance when legitimacy cues remain consistent, (3) contested equilibrium—coordination without acceptance, (4) why performance feedback often fails to change behavior without legitimacy cue shifts. |
| **Sensemaking (Weick, 1995)** | Meaning-making under ambiguity/uncertainty; how "enacted" environments become sensible. | People interpret equivocal cues retrospectively and socially; action and interpretation co-produce what seems real/meaningful. | Structure is often treated as emerging from and shaping ongoing sensemaking/enactment. | Change can follow shifts in interpretation, attention, and enacted environments (often triggered by surprises/breakdowns). | How groups make sense of confusing events; how interpretations coordinate action; ongoing constitution of reality. | Less centered on legitimacy as distinct construct; persistence over long horizons may require adding complementary concepts (institutions, routines, power). ICT adds legitimacy and memory mechanisms. |
| **Complex Responsive Processes (CRP)** | Organizing as ongoing communicative interaction; patterns as continually reproduced in interaction. | Order and novelty arise in flow of interaction (power, identity, meaning negotiated in real time). | "Structure" typically treated as abstraction/description of recurrent interaction patterns rather than separable causal entity. | Change is inherently emergent and unpredictable; novelty arises through interaction dynamics. | Process ontology of organizing; rich descriptions of how interaction produces stability/novelty; avoids reification. | Often intentionally avoids prescriptive diagnostics or intervention recipes; empirical operationalization can be demanding. ICT shares process ontology but retains structure-as-noun language and offers diagnostic frameworks. |
| **Human Systems Dynamics (CDE)** | How local interaction conditions (Containers, Differences, Exchanges) shape emergent patterns. | Patterns emerge from constraints on interaction and information/energy flow; small shifts in C/D/E can change what emerges. | Structure not always foregrounded; emphasis on interaction conditions producing patterns. | Change pursued by adjusting interaction conditions and observing emergent effects. | Practical experimentation with small condition changes; explaining why small constraints can yield large pattern shifts. | Less focused on long-horizon persistence/memory mechanisms unless supplemented with concepts of history, institutionalization, or learning. ICT adds memory and legitimacy as stabilizing forces. |

## A Brief Example

An organization wants teams to experiment more. Leaders announce the change, provide training, and emphasize innovation. Yet behavior does not shift.

From an Interpretive Conditions perspective, audit cues across the six domains:

**Data & Feedback:** What gets measured and reviewed?

* Do performance reviews emphasize experimentation or flawless execution?
* Are metrics focused on efficiency (utilization, cycle time) or learning (experiments run, insights generated)?
* What data is visible about experiments others have tried?

**Tools & Processes:** What does the system make easy or difficult?

* Do approval processes require extensive justification before trying anything?
* Are tools optimized for efficiency (making experimentation costly) or iteration (making it cheap)?
* Are there protected resources (time, budget, space) for experiments?
* Do tools provide language for "experiments" or only "deliverables"?

**Capacity:** Do people actually have time to experiment?

* Is experimentation "in addition to" regular work or does it replace something?
* Are people already at 100% utilization on existing priorities?
* Can people say "no" to existing work to make room for experiments?
* Do competing demands from other initiatives consume available time?
* Are people authorized to redirect resources toward experiments?

**Skills & Knowledge:** Can people actually do this?

* Have people been trained in rapid prototyping, hypothesis testing, learning from failure?
* Are there accessible examples and templates?
* Can people observe successful experimentation by others?

**Motivation & Values:** Is this connected to what matters?

* Do promotions go to people who executed flawlessly or those who learned through experimentation?
* Are bonuses tied to meeting targets (discouraging risk) or generating insights?
* Do leaders visibly protect and reward people who experiment?

**Norms & Expectations:** What actually happens when people try something new?

* Are experiments celebrated or scrutinized?
* Are "failures" treated as learning or career-limiting?
* Do successful experiments lead to visibility and opportunity?
* What stories circulate about past experiments?

**If the consistency pattern across domains says:**

* Leaders SAY "innovate" (words in Norms domain)
* Tools make it costly and use delivery-focused language (friction in Tools domain, cognitive mismatch)
* Metrics punish variation (Data domain signals efficiency focus)
* Mistakes are discussed publicly (Norms domain signals risk)
* Promotions go to flawless executors (Motivation domain misalignment)
* **AND people are already working 50-hour weeks with no slack capacity** (Capacity domain signals impossibility)

**Then the system is teaching:** "Innovation is espoused, but structurally impossible to enact and cognitively difficult to envision."

**The capacity constraint alone can prevent change even if all other domains align.** If people genuinely want to innovate (Motivation ✓), know how (Skills ✓), have tools (Processes ✓), and see it's measured (Data ✓), but simply don't have time or authority, innovation won't happen.

The structure that forms is risk-avoidance, regardless of what leaders say they want. People respond to the consistency pattern across domains, not the words.

**For change to occur:**

Conditions across domains must shift to make experimentation legitimate:

* Protect early experimenters from negative consequences
* Create tools/processes that make trying things easy and use appropriate language ("hypotheses," "experiments," "learning")
* Measure and celebrate learning, not just success
* Train people in experimentation methods
* Connect experimentation to advancement and rewards
* **Create actual capacity** by removing competing priorities, creating protected time, or expanding authority boundaries

When cues align consistently across domains, legitimacy can converge. When enough people enact the new response (experimenting), and it gets repeated enough that distributed learning occurs ("experimenting here is safe and rewarded"), the structure shifts.

**The pattern persists only through continuous reenactment.** If conditions revert, the pattern will too.

## A Closer Look

### When Encouragement Isn't Enough

Organizations often encourage behaviors they genuinely want to see—speaking up, taking initiative, experimenting, or collaborating across boundaries. Leaders may communicate these intentions clearly and repeatedly. Yet the behavior often fails to appear, or appears briefly and then fades.

Interpretive Conditions Theory explains why encouragement alone is rarely sufficient.

**Consider a team where leaders regularly say, "If you see a problem, raise it."**

On the surface, this message signals openness. However, over time, other conditions may tell a different story:

* When concerns are raised, meetings run long and other priorities get delayed
* The person who spoke up is subtly labeled as "difficult" or "not a team player"
* Issues raised are acknowledged but rarely result in visible action
* Leaders become defensive or ask for extensive documentation before considering the concern
* People who stay quiet and execute are praised for being "low-maintenance"

**No one explicitly discourages speaking up, but the system's responses create cues about risk and legitimacy.**

Eventually, team members stop raising concerns—not because they disagree with the message, but because they have learned what the system actually rewards. Silence becomes the sensible response.

**Each person learns through their own experience and observation:**

* "I raised that process issue and nothing changed except people seemed annoyed"
* "Jamie questioned the timeline and got a reputation for being negative"
* "In my review I was told to focus on solutions not problems"
* "The people who get promoted never rock the boat"

When these distributed individual learnings overlap enough, coordinated pattern emerges: everyone stays silent. The structure exists not in any policy or chart, but in the continuous enactment of silent responses.

**Importantly, this pattern often persists even after leadership changes or new messaging is introduced. The structure has already formed through distributed learning.**

New leaders arrive and say "we really do want to hear concerns!" But people have learned otherwise through experience. Until conditions across domains actually shift—until speaking up is protected, rewarded, connected to advancement, and results in visible action—the pattern persists.

**Interpretive Conditions Theory highlights that people are not responding to what leaders say they want; they are responding to what the system has taught them through consistent cues across multiple domains.**

In this way, persistent silence reflects organizational memory continuously enacted, not individual attitude or courage.

**This example illustrates a core insight of the theory:**

Behavior that appears resistant or irrational is often a rational response to the interpretive conditions people face. To change behavior sustainably, leaders must look beyond messages and intentions and examine the conditions—across all six domains—that continue to shape interpretation through consistent cues.

## Key Terms

**Interpretive Conditions Theory**
:   An interpretive-institutional theory of organizing that explains persistent patterns of behavior as responses to conditions people interpret as legitimate, risky, or worthwhile over time, with patterns persisting only through continuous coordinated reenactment.

**Human Systems**
:   Collectives in which coordination and stability emerge through ongoing interpretation and response rather than through direct control or compliance.

**Conditions**
:   External, observable features of the environment that people encounter and interpret when deciding how to act. Conditions shape meaning often implicitly, and sometimes prior to explicit deliberation. Conditions are both input (what people respond to) and output (created through coordinated responses) in a recursive loop.

**Legitimacy**
:   The perceived acceptability or appropriateness of an action within a system, shaping what people feel able to do regardless of formal permission. Learned through experience by observing what happens when actions are taken.

**Agency**
:   The capacity of people to choose how they respond to conditions, even when options are constrained. Agency is how structures are recreated or changed—every response is enactment that either reproduces or shifts the pattern.

**Domains of Influence**
:   Six analytically distinct categories of environmental and social cues through which legitimacy is signaled and learned: (1) Data & Feedback, (2) Tools & Processes, (3) Capacity, (4) Skills & Knowledge, (5) Motivation & Values (all structural/environmental), and (6) Norms & Expectations (collective/social). Adapted from Gilbert's (1978) Behavior Engineering Model with the addition of Norms & Expectations as the collective interpretive layer. People interpret legitimacy by reading signals across all domains simultaneously.

**Cues**
:   Observable signals drawn from conditions that indicate what actions are legitimate, risky, or worthwhile. Cues operate through cross-domain consistency—when multiple cues across multiple domains consistently point in the same direction, they create coherent signals about legitimacy.

**Interpretation**
:   The sensemaking process through which individuals assess cues and determine what actions make sense within the system.

**Response**
:   The actions people take—or avoid—based on their interpretation of legitimacy and risk. Responses can reproduce existing patterns, vary slightly, violate and test patterns, or (when coordinated) create new patterns.

**Structures**
:   Patterns continuously recreated through coordinated action. Structures exist as distributed memory (what people have collectively learned through overlapping experience) and persist only through ongoing reenactment. Not objects or stored information, but observable regularity in coordinated responses.

**Distributed Memory**
:   What people have collectively learned, through overlapping experiences, about what responses are legitimate, safe, or worthwhile. No single person holds "the structure"—everyone holds fragments, and overlap creates apparent coherence and enables coordination.

**Coordination Tipping Point**
:   The threshold at which a practice becomes the easiest way to coordinate work, regardless of whether it's considered legitimate. Occurs through network effects, tool dependencies, and process integration.

**Legitimacy Tipping Point**
:   The threshold at which a practice becomes taken-for-granted as sensible/appropriate. People defend it even when it disadvantages them. Dissent becomes socially weird, not just inconvenient.

**Contested Equilibrium**
:   A stable state in which practices are routinely enacted (coordination has tipped) but legitimacy remains persistently contested. Behavioral stability without interpretive convergence. Not failed institutionalization but a predictable attractor when enforcement sustains behavior while cue environments remain contradictory.

**Change**
:   A shift in the conditions people respond to—particularly legitimacy cues across domains—combined with coordinated enactment of new responses that, through repetition, create new distributed memory. Not a declaration of goals, attitudes, or desired end states.
