                    <p><strong>How Legitimacy, Interpretation, and Memory Shape Organizing</strong><br>
                        Matthew Carlson</p>

                    <hr>

                    <h2 id="how-to-read-ict">How to Read Interpretive Conditions Theory</h2>

                    <p>Interpretive Conditions Theory is an interpretive communication theory of organizing. Rather than
                        predicting behavior or prescribing solutions, it explains how patterns of behavior emerge and
                        persist in human systems.</p>

                    <p>As you read, keep three things in mind:</p>

                    <p><strong>1. This theory explains patterns, not individuals.</strong></p>

                    <p><strong>2. &quot;Conditions&quot; are not attitudes or personalities.</strong><br>
                        The theory focuses on external conditions people encounter-such as norms, rules, tools,
                        feedback, and constraints-and how systems learn from repeated responses to those conditions.</p>

                    <p><strong>3. &quot;Structure&quot; means patterns continuously recreated through action, not
                        organizational charts or formal designs.</strong></p>

                    <p>Think of structure the way you think of language. English doesn&#x27;t exist stored somewhere-it
                        exists only in the continuous practice of speaking and writing it. No single person knows all of
                        English. Each person holds fragments: vocabulary, grammar patterns, idioms they use. It &quot;exists&quot;
                        as structure only because enough people enact overlapping-enough patterns that mutual
                        intelligibility emerges.</p>

                    <p>If everyone stopped speaking English tomorrow, it would cease to exist as a living structure. New
                        speakers learn it by participating, not by accessing some stored &quot;English object.&quot;</p>

                    <p><strong>Organizational structures work the same way.</strong> What we call &quot;the culture&quot;
                        or &quot;how things work here&quot; exists only in continuous enactment. Each person holds
                        fragments-what they&#x27;ve learned about what&#x27;s legitimate, safe, or worthwhile. When
                        enough people enact overlapping patterns, it feels like a shared structure. But that structure
                        persists only through ongoing reproduction. If people stopped enacting it, it would dissolve.
                    </p>

                    <p>This learning is displayed through what people come to take for granted: what questions are safe
                        to ask, which risks are avoided, how decisions really get made, where work slows down, and what
                        &quot;everyone knows&quot; without needing to say out loud. These shared understandings aren&#x27;t
                        written anywhere, but they reliably guide behavior.</p>

                    <p>This is what people often describe informally as culture-what you &quot;just know&quot; once you&#x27;ve
                        been in a system long enough-but in Interpretive Conditions Theory, these patterns are treated
                        as visible evidence of what the system has learned from past responses, rather than taking
                        stated values or attitudes as the primary explanatory driver.</p>

                    <p>Read Interpretive Conditions Theory as an explanation of how organizing works when people
                        interpret their environment and respond to what feels legitimate, risky, or possible-and how
                        those responses, repeated and overlapping, create patterns that persist only through continuous
                        reenactment.</p>

                    <p>As with many interpretive theories, the value of Interpretive Conditions Theory lies not in
                        prediction, but in helping you see what is shaping behavior that might otherwise feel confusing
                        or irrational.</p>

                    <hr>

                    <h2 id="theory">Theory</h2>

                    <p><strong>Interpretive Conditions Theory</strong> is an interpretive-institutional theory of
                        organizing that explains persistent patterns of behavior as responses to conditions people
                        interpret as legitimate, risky, or worthwhile over time. Rather than viewing organizations as
                        systems that execute plans or individuals as actors who simply follow rules, the theory
                        conceptualizes organizing as an ongoing process of interpretation and response shaped by
                        environmental conditions.</p>

                    <p>Interpretive Conditions Theory treats people as active agents who interpret and respond to
                        conditions, exercising agency within constraints rather than responding as if behavior were
                        mechanically determined.</p>

                    <p>In Interpretive Conditions Theory, organizing unfolds through a recurring dynamic: conditions
                        shape what is visible and possible; legitimacy orients what actions make sense; agency
                        determines how people respond; and repeated responses create patterns that guide future
                        behavior.</p>

                    <p>From this perspective, people do not primarily change behavior because they are instructed to do
                        so or persuaded to adopt new attitudes. Instead, behavior often emerges as a locally sensible
                        response to what the system has taught people-through experience-about which actions are safe,
                        expected, rewarded, or punished. Over time, these responses stabilize into patterns that guide
                        future behavior, even when original intentions or circumstances have changed.</p>

                    <hr>

                    <h2 id="core-assumptions">Core Assumptions</h2>

                    <p>Interpretive Conditions Theory rests on five central assumptions:</p>

                    <p><strong>1. Human systems are interpretive and agentic.</strong><br>
                        People actively interpret their environment and choose how to respond to it; they are not
                        components reacting automatically to system design.</p>

                    <p><strong>2. Legitimacy orients action.</strong><br>
                        In most organizational settings, people are more likely to take (or avoid) actions that feel
                        acceptable, safe, or worthwhile given the system&#x27;s cues-often implicitly rather than
                        through conscious deliberation.</p>

                    <p><strong>3. Meaning is environmentally produced.</strong><br>
                        Leaders rarely change beliefs or motivation reliably through messaging alone; what they can
                        shape more consistently are the conditions people interpret and respond to.</p>

                    <p><strong>4. Persistence is learned, not imposed.</strong><br>
                        Stable patterns of behavior arise through repeated responses that become normalized over time.
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>5. Change is conditional, not declarative.</strong><br>
                        Sustainable change occurs when the conditions people respond to shift, not when end states are
                        announced.</p>

                    <hr>

                    <h2 id="understanding-structure-as-process">Understanding Structure as Process</h2>

                    <p>Before exploring the key concepts, it&#x27;s essential to understand what Interpretive Conditions
                        Theory means by &quot;structure,&quot; because it differs from how the term is typically
                        used.</p>

                    <h3>Structures Don&#x27;t Exist-Structuring Exists</h3>

                    <p>Most organizational thinking treats structures as things: org charts, policies, systems, &quot;the
                        culture.&quot; These are treated as if they exist independently and influence people&#x27;s
                        behavior.</p>

                    <p><strong>Interpretive Conditions Theory takes a different view:</strong></p>

                    <p><strong>Structures are not things. They are patterns that exist only in continuous coordinated
                        enactment.</strong></p>

                    <p>Consider how a path forms through snow. The first person makes tracks. The second finds it easier
                        to follow those tracks. Eventually a visible path forms-but only because people keep walking it.
                        If everyone stops using it, the next snowfall erases it. The path &quot;remembers&quot; where
                        people walked, but only as long as walking continues.</p>

                    <p>Organizational structures work the same way. They persist not because they&#x27;re stored
                        somewhere, but because people continue to enact learned responses. When we say &quot;the
                        structure&quot; persists, what we mean is: <strong>people keep recreating the pattern.</strong>
                    </p>

                    <h3>Memory Is Distributed, Not Stored</h3>

                    <p>When ICT talks about &quot;organizational memory,&quot; it doesn&#x27;t mean information stored
                        in a database or written in policies.</p>

                    <p><strong>It means: what people have collectively learned through overlapping experiences about
                        what responses are legitimate, safe, or worthwhile.</strong></p>

                    <p>No one person holds &quot;the structure.&quot; Everyone holds fragments:</p>

                    <ul>

                        <li>What I&#x27;ve learned happens when I speak up</li>

                        <li>What I&#x27;ve observed happens to others who tried something new</li>

                        <li>What consequences I&#x27;ve experienced when I broke a rule</li>

                        <li>What I&#x27;ve been rewarded for, ignored for, or punished for</li>

                    </ul>

                    <p>When enough people have learned overlapping patterns-when our fragments align enough-it creates
                        mutual intelligibility. We can coordinate. The pattern feels real and shared.</p>

                    <p><strong>But it exists nowhere except in our continuous coordinated enactment of those learned
                        responses.</strong></p>

                    <h3>Multiple Structures Operate Simultaneously</h3>

                    <p>Each person navigates multiple structures at any given moment:</p>

                    <ul>

                        <li>Work structures (organizational norms, team practices, professional identity)</li>

                        <li>Family structures (household routines, parenting patterns, relationship dynamics)</li>

                        <li>Community structures (neighborhood expectations, civic participation)</li>

                        <li>National/cultural structures (language, holidays, taken-for-granted social norms)</li>

                    </ul>

                    <p>These aren&#x27;t separate &quot;parts of life.&quot; They&#x27;re different pattern-contexts,
                        each with its own legitimacy rules, that you&#x27;re constantly assessing and switching
                        between:</p>

                    <ul>

                        <li>You don&#x27;t talk to your boss the same way you talk to your kids</li>

                        <li>What&#x27;s funny at home might be inappropriate at work</li>

                        <li>What&#x27;s efficient with your team might be rude with your spouse</li>

                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>At any moment, multiple structures are potentially relevant.</strong></p>

                    <p>When your boss texts at 8pm, which structure applies? Work or family time? The ambiguity creates
                        interpretive difficulty because multiple structures are simultaneously active, each suggesting
                        different responses.</p>

                    <p><strong>Organizational change often fails because it assumes people operate in a single
                        structure.</strong> In reality, people are navigating multiple overlapping structures, and the
                        new organizational pattern may conflict with family structures, professional identity
                        structures, or community structures that are equally real and consequential.</p>

                    <h3>Structures Persist Through Reenactment, Not Inertia</h3>

                    <p>Because structures exist only in continuous doing, they require ongoing reproduction to
                        persist.</p>

                    <p><strong>This has profound implications:</strong></p>

                    <p><strong>Change doesn&#x27;t require &quot;overcoming&quot; structure.</strong> It requires
                        coordinated shifts in enactment. If people stop recreating the old pattern and start enacting a
                        different one-and do so consistently enough that overlap emerges-a new structure forms.</p>

                    <p><strong>Stability doesn&#x27;t mean resistance.</strong> It means people keep finding the learned
                        response sensible, safe, or worthwhile given the conditions they&#x27;re interpreting. The
                        pattern persists because it&#x27;s continuously recreated, not because it&#x27;s stored
                        somewhere preventing change.</p>

                    <p><strong>&quot;Strong cultures&quot; aren&#x27;t hard to change because they&#x27;re deeply
                        embedded.</strong> They&#x27;re hard to change because many people have learned deeply
                        overlapping patterns, making coordination around a new pattern difficult. But if conditions
                        shift enough that coordinated enactment shifts, even deeply learned structures can dissolve
                        surprisingly quickly.</p>

                    <h2 id="key-concepts">Key Concepts</h2>

                    <h3>Conditions</h3>

                    <p><strong>Conditions are the environmental features people encounter and interpret as they decide
                        how to act.</strong></p>

                    <p>Interpretive Conditions Theory prioritizes external, observable conditions-norms, rules, tools,
                        feedback, constraints-as the primary analytic entry point, rather than modeling internal traits
                        such as personality.</p>

                    <p>Conditions matter because they shape what actions feel legitimate or risky, often prior to or
                        alongside explicit deliberation.</p>

                    <p><strong>Importantly, not all conditions shape behavior through interpretation alone.</strong>
                        Some conditions constrain action directly by limiting what is possible, regardless of how an
                        action is interpreted:</p>

                    <ul>

                        <li>Tool capabilities limit what can be done</li>

                        <li>Budget limits restrict options</li>

                        <li>Formal authority determines permissions</li>

                        <li>Legal requirements create boundaries</li>

                        <li>Veto power constrains choices</li>

                    </ul>

                    <p>These function as conditions that restrict action through <strong>capacity and
                        permission</strong>, not just meaning.</p>

                    <p>However, repeated responses to these constraints also stabilize into structure over time. People
                        learn workarounds, develop informal processes, or simply accept limitations as &quot;how things
                        are.&quot;</p>

                    <p><strong>Crucially, conditions are both input and output in a recursive loop:</strong></p>

                    <ul>

                        <li>Conditions shape how people interpret what&#x27;s legitimate</li>

                        <li>People respond based on those interpretations</li>

                        <li>Repeated responses create new conditions (patterns others observe and respond to)</li>

                        <li>These new conditions shape the next round of interpretation</li>

                    </ul>

                    <p>This recursion is why organizational change is challenging: structures are simultaneously the
                        environment people respond to AND the outcome of those responses.</p>

                    <h3>Legitimacy</h3>

                    <p><strong>Legitimacy refers to the shared sense of what actions are acceptable, safe, or worth the
                        effort within a system.</strong></p>

                    <p>It is not limited to formal authority, legality, or moral approval. In Interpretive Conditions
                        Theory, legitimacy describes how people judge whether an action &quot;makes sense&quot; given
                        the risks, norms, constraints, and past responses of the system.</p>

                    <p><strong>Legitimacy is learned through experience.</strong> People infer it by observing what
                        happens when certain actions are taken-what is rewarded, ignored, discouraged, or punished. Over
                        time, these judgments stabilize into pattern, shaping what actions feel possible without
                        requiring explicit instruction or enforcement.</p>

                    <p><strong>Legitimacy operates across a spectrum:</strong></p>

                    <p><strong>Contested legitimacy:</strong> Actions require explicit justification or deliberation.
                        &quot;Should I do this? What will happen?&quot; This is where most organizational change lives.
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>Routine legitimacy:</strong> Actions are normal and expected but still conscious. &quot;This
                        is what we do here.&quot;</p>

                    <p><strong>Taken-for-granted legitimacy:</strong> Actions are so obvious that alternatives aren&#x27;t
                        considered. &quot;Of course we do it this way.&quot; This is legitimacy&#x27;s most powerful
                        state-when it becomes invisible.</p>

                    <p><strong>Critical insight: Legitimacy is phenomenological, relational, and institutional
                        simultaneously.</strong></p>

                    <ul>

                        <li><strong>Phenomenological:</strong> A felt sense of whether an action is worth the likely
                            consequence
                        </li>

                        <li><strong>Relational:</strong> How meanings are negotiated, reinforced, or corrected in
                            interaction with others
                        </li>

                        <li><strong>Institutional:</strong> When action becomes obvious and legitimacy collapses into
                            structure-enacted without thought
                        </li>

                    </ul>

                    <h3>Agency</h3>

                    <p><strong>Agency refers to the capacity of people to choose how they respond to conditions, even
                        when options are constrained.</strong></p>

                    <p>In Interpretive Conditions Theory, individuals are not passive recipients of structure; they
                        interpret, comply, resist, adapt, and improvise based on what feels legitimate, risky, or
                        possible.</p>

                    <p><strong>Agency does not imply unlimited freedom.</strong> It is always exercised within
                        conditions and constraints.</p>

                    <p><strong>But here&#x27;s the critical connection to structure:</strong></p>

                    <p><strong>Agency is HOW structures are recreated or changed.</strong></p>

                    <p>Every moment of interpretation and response is an opportunity for:</p>

                    <ul>

                        <li><strong>Reproducing the existing pattern</strong> (structure persists through reenactment)
                        </li>

                        <li><strong>Slight variation</strong> (structure evolves gradually)</li>

                        <li><strong>Violation</strong> (structure is tested; what happens reveals its strength)</li>

                        <li><strong>Coordinated change</strong> (structure dissolves or transforms when enough people
                            enact differently)
                        </li>

                    </ul>

                    <p>Over time, the cumulative exercise of agency-millions of small choices about how to
                        respond-shapes and reshapes patterns. These patterns, when they become reliably coordinated, are
                        what we call structures.</p>

                    <p><strong>This means structures don&#x27;t constrain agency in the traditional sense.</strong>
                        Rather, structures are the accumulated outcome of agency exercised under past conditions, now
                        functioning as conditions for the next round of interpretation and response.</p>

                    <h3>Domains of Influence</h3>

                    <p>The theory identifies five domains of influence through which legitimacy is most commonly
                        signaled and learned:</p>

                    <ul>

                        <li><strong>Norms &amp; Expectations</strong> – what behavior is taken for granted, praised,
                            ignored, or quietly penalized
                        </li>

                        <li><strong>Rules, Processes, &amp; Tools</strong> – formal and informal mechanisms that shape
                            how work is done
                        </li>

                        <li><strong>Data &amp; Feedback</strong> – what information is visible, reviewed, and acted upon
                        </li>

                        <li><strong>Skills &amp; Knowledge</strong> – what the environment makes learnable,
                            transferable, and usable
                        </li>

                        <li><strong>Motivation &amp; Values</strong> – what the system rewards, discourages, or makes
                            meaningful
                        </li>

                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>These domains represent correlated sets of cues through which legitimacy is signaled and
                        learned.</strong></p>

                    <p>For any given structure (a practice, norm, or pattern), people interpret legitimacy by reading
                        signals across all five domains simultaneously.</p>

                    <p><strong>Think of domains as different channels broadcasting legitimacy signals:</strong></p>

                    <p>When people are deciding &quot;Is this action legitimate here?&quot;, they&#x27;re not reading
                        one signal. They&#x27;re triangulating across multiple types of cues:</p>

                    <ul>

                        <li>What do norms suggest? (Do people like me do this? What happened to others who tried?)</li>

                        <li>What do tools enable? (Is this even possible? Does the system support it?)</li>

                        <li>What gets measured? (Will this show up in my review? Does anyone track it?)</li>

                        <li>Do I know how? (Have I been trained? Is support available?)</li>

                        <li>Does this matter? (Is it connected to what&#x27;s rewarded? Does leadership care?)</li>

                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>When domains align-when cues across all five domains point the same direction-legitimacy
                        can converge:</strong></p>

                    <p>&quot;Yes, this is clearly what we do here. All signals confirm it.&quot;</p>

                    <p><strong>When domains send contradictory signals, legitimacy remains contested:</strong></p>

                    <p>&quot;Leaders say they want X, but tools don&#x27;t support it, nobody&#x27;s trained on it, it&#x27;s
                        not measured, and people who try it get penalized.&quot;</p>

                    <p><strong>This is why messaging alone fails.</strong> Changing what leaders say (one domain) while
                        leaving the other four unchanged means the correlation pattern still teaches the old response.
                        People read the full pattern, not just the words.</p>

                    <p><strong>The domains are not exhaustive.</strong> They represent the most common and observable
                        surfaces through which legitimacy and constraint are learned and reinforced in organizational
                        systems. They function as a diagnostic lens, not a complete inventory of causal forces.</p>

                    <p><strong>Practical application:</strong></p>

                    <p>For any change initiative, audit all five domains:</p>

                    <ul>

                        <li>Do norms actually support the new practice, or just words?</li>

                        <li>Do tools make it easy or create friction?</li>

                        <li>Does data/feedback reinforce it or ignore it?</li>

                        <li>Do people have the skills, or are they improvising?</li>

                        <li>Is it connected to what matters (promotions, bonuses, recognition)?</li>

                    </ul>

                    <p>If the answer differs across domains → contradictory cues → legitimacy won&#x27;t converge →
                        change won&#x27;t stick.</p>

                    <h3>Cues</h3>

                    <p><strong>Cues are the observable signals people read from domains to infer legitimacy.</strong>
                    </p>

                    <p>Cues include:</p>

                    <ul>

                        <li>Leadership attention (what leaders spend time on, ask about, ignore)</li>

                        <li>Patterns of reward and punishment (who gets promoted, who gets sidelined)</li>

                        <li>Silence around certain topics (what can&#x27;t be discussed)</li>

                        <li>Consistency-or inconsistency-between words and actions</li>

                        <li>What gets measured and reviewed</li>

                        <li>Who gets resources and support</li>

                        <li>How mistakes are treated</li>

                        <li>What&#x27;s celebrated in stories and rituals</li>

                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Cues often operate implicitly.</strong> People may not be able to name them, but they
                        reliably shape behavior by signaling what is safe or dangerous to attempt.</p>

                    <p><strong>The power of cues lies in their correlation across domains.</strong> A single cue might
                        be ambiguous, but when multiple cues across multiple domains align, they create a coherent
                        signal about legitimacy.</p>

                    <h3>Interpretation and Response</h3>

                    <p><strong>Interpretation</strong> refers to the sensemaking process through which individuals
                        assign meaning to cues.</p>

                    <p><strong>Response</strong> is the action that follows.</p>

                    <p>Importantly, responses are often adaptive rather than intentional. People act in ways that align
                        with what the system appears to reward or tolerate, even when those responses contradict stated
                        values or official policy.</p>

                    <p><strong>This is not deception or bad faith.</strong> It&#x27;s rational navigation of the cue
                        environment.</p>

                    <p>When someone says &quot;we value innovation&quot; but every cue signals &quot;don&#x27;t make
                        mistakes,&quot; responding with caution is the sensible interpretation of conditions, not
                        resistance to change.</p>

                    <h3>Structures as Pattern Continuously Recreated</h3>

                    <p>In Interpretive Conditions Theory, <strong>structures are not charts, plans, or designs. They are
                        stabilized patterns of response that persist through continuous reenactment.</strong></p>

                    <p>When certain responses repeatedly lead to reward or safety, they become normalized. When
                        responses lead to risk or punishment, they are avoided. Over time, the system &quot;learns&quot;
                        these patterns through distributed individual experience, and future behavior is shaped by this
                        collective learning-even when original conditions have changed.</p>

                    <p>Structures form not only through signals of legitimacy and risk, but also through repeated
                        adaptation to constraint-such as workarounds, delays, or avoidance shaped by tool limits,
                        authority boundaries, or resource restrictions.</p>

                    <p><strong>Structures thus function as organizational memory-but not as information stored
                        somewhere.</strong></p>

                    <p>When we say a structure &quot;remembers,&quot; we mean: people have collectively learned, through
                        overlapping experience, what responses are legitimate or viable. This learning guides behavior
                        without requiring constant enforcement.</p>

                    <p><strong>Example: The vacation structure</strong></p>

                    <p>In many workplaces, official policies say employees are encouraged to take time off, or even that
                        vacation is unlimited. Yet people quickly learn how much vacation is actually acceptable by:</p>

                    <ul>

                        <li>Watching who takes time off</li>

                        <li>Observing how it&#x27;s discussed</li>

                        <li>Noticing whether there are consequences afterward</li>

                        <li>Seeing what happens during busy periods</li>

                        <li>Hearing stories about people who &quot;took too much&quot;</li>

                    </ul>

                    <p>Over time, employees &quot;just know&quot; how much absence is safe, regardless of what the
                        policy states.</p>

                    <p><strong>This &quot;knowing&quot; only exists because people keep enacting the pattern:</strong>
                    </p>

                    <ul>

                        <li>People take &quot;safe&quot; amounts of vacation</li>

                        <li>Managers approve those amounts without comment</li>

                        <li>Taking more triggers subtle or explicit consequences</li>

                        <li>Stories circulate reinforcing the pattern</li>

                        <li>New employees observe and learn the same limits</li>

                    </ul>

                    <p>If everyone started taking unlimited vacation tomorrow and nothing bad happened, the structure
                        would dissolve. It persists only through continuous reproduction.</p>

                    <p><strong>Key implication: Structures are fragile in ways we don&#x27;t typically
                        recognize.</strong></p>

                    <p>They feel solid and enduring, but they exist only in ongoing enactment. When conditions shift
                        enough that coordinated enactment shifts, even deeply learned structures can change rapidly.</p>

                    <p>Conversely, structures can persist long after formal conditions change, because people continue
                        enacting learned patterns until new coordinated responses emerge.</p>

                    <hr>

                    <h2 id="explaining-stability">Explaining Stability</h2>


                    <p>The theory explains organizational stability as a consequence of learned interpretation, not
                        resistance to change.</p>

                    <p><strong>Patterns persist because people keep finding them sensible, safe, or necessary-not
                        because the patterns are stored somewhere preventing change.</strong></p>

                    <p>Consider a team that once experienced negative consequences for raising concerns. Members
                        learned: &quot;speaking up here is risky.&quot; Even after leadership changes, people may remain
                        silent. No one needs to enforce silence; the structure has already formed through distributed
                        learning. The system continues to respond to what it has learned about risk.</p>

                    <p>Each person holds a fragment of this memory:</p>

                    <ul>

                        <li>&quot;I saw what happened to Jamie when they questioned the approach&quot;</li>

                        <li>&quot;My first week, someone warned me to keep my head down&quot;</li>

                        <li>&quot;In my review, I was told I wasn&#x27;t a &#x27;team player&#x27; after I raised an
                            issue&quot;
                        </li>

                        <li>&quot;Meetings end quickly when no one disagrees&quot;</li>

                    </ul>

                    <p>When these fragments overlap enough, they create coordinated enactment: everyone stays silent.
                        The pattern feels real and shared, even though it exists nowhere except in the continuous
                        reproduction of silent responses.</p>

                    <p><strong>This explains why:</strong></p>

                    <ul>

                        <li>Change initiatives revert under pressure (old patterns feel safer)</li>

                        <li>Training fails to translate into practice (learned conditions override training)</li>

                        <li>&quot;We tried that once&quot; continues to carry weight (that attempt is part of the
                            memory)
                        </li>

                        <li>New leaders inherit patterns they didn&#x27;t create (because everyone else still enacts
                            them)
                        </li>

                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Stability is not stubbornness; it is memory continuously enacted.</strong></p>

                    <h2 id="explaining-change">Explaining Change</h2>

                    <p>Change occurs when conditions shift sufficiently that different responses become legitimate-and
                        when enough people begin enacting those different responses that a new coordinated pattern
                        emerges.</p>

                    <p><strong>This may involve:</strong></p>

                    <ul>

                        <li>Altering feedback loops (change what gets measured, discussed, rewarded)</li>

                        <li>Redistributing decision authority (change who can make which choices)</li>

                        <li>Changing what is visible or invisible (transparency or opacity around different
                            information)
                        </li>

                        <li>Redefining success and failure (change what counts as &quot;good&quot; performance)</li>

                        <li>Reducing or redistributing risk (make new responses safer through protection, support, or
                            collective action)
                        </li>

                        <li>Aligning cues across domains (ensure all five domains signal the new pattern)</li>

                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Critical insight: Change requires both condition shifts AND coordinated enactment of new
                        responses.</strong></p>

                    <p>Changing conditions alone isn&#x27;t sufficient if people don&#x27;t enact different responses.
                        And people enacting different responses isn&#x27;t sustainable if conditions still punish those
                        responses.</p>

                    <p><strong>Change stabilizes when:</strong></p>

                    <ol>

                        <li>Conditions shift to make new responses legitimate</li>

                        <li>Enough people enact the new response that it becomes coordinated</li>

                        <li>The new pattern gets repeated enough that it becomes learned</li>

                        <li>Distributed memory now encodes the new pattern as &quot;how we do things&quot;</li>

                    </ol>

                    <p><strong>Interpretive Conditions Theory does not promise predictable outcomes.</strong> People may
                        still respond in unexpected ways. However, it asserts that without meaningful condition change,
                        new behavior often fails to persist-especially once attention, novelty, or pressure fades.</p>

                    <p><strong>Two types of change failure:</strong></p>

                    <p><strong>Type 1: Conditions don&#x27;t actually change</strong></p>

                    <ul>

                        <li>Leaders announce new values but cues across domains still reinforce old patterns</li>

                        <li>Result: Brief compliance followed by reversion</li>

                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Type 2: Coordination doesn&#x27;t emerge</strong></p>

                    <ul>

                        <li>Conditions shift but people don&#x27;t enact new responses at sufficient scale/consistency
                        </li>

                        <li>Result: Scattered adoption, no pattern formation, eventual abandonment</li>

                    </ul>

                    <p>Successful change requires both.</p>

                    <h2 id="coordination-legitimacy-distinction">The Coordination-Legitimacy Distinction</h2>


                    <p>A critical refinement in Interpretive Conditions Theory distinguishes between two types of &quot;tipping
                        points&quot; that are often conflated:</p>

                    <h3>The Coordination Tipping Point (Behavioral Convergence)</h3>

                    <p><strong>People comply because the practice becomes the cheapest way to coordinate:</strong></p>

                    <ul>

                        <li>Tools/processes become mandatory to get work done</li>

                        <li>Dependencies assume participation</li>

                        <li>Opt-out becomes costly (friction, delays, exclusion from information/decisions)</li>

                    </ul>

                    <p>This can happen <strong>without legitimacy.</strong> It&#x27;s &quot;I do it because I have to&quot;
                        or &quot;because everything else now depends on it.&quot;</p>

                    <h3>The Legitimacy Tipping Point (Interpretive Convergence)</h3>

                    <p><strong>People comply because the practice becomes taken-for-granted as
                        sensible/appropriate:</strong></p>

                    <ul>

                        <li>&quot;This is how we do things&quot;</li>

                        <li>Dissent becomes socially weird, not just inconvenient</li>

                        <li>People defend the practice even when it disadvantages them</li>

                    </ul>

                    <p>This is what institutional theory often assumes eventually happens through repeated enactment
                        (sedimentation leading to taken-for-grantedness).</p>

                    <h3>The Key ICT Insight: These Can Decouple</h3>

                    <p><strong>Coordination can tip while legitimacy remains contested.</strong></p>

                    <p>This produces <strong>contested equilibrium</strong>-a stable state in which:</p>

                    <ul>

                        <li>Practices are routinely enacted (behavioral stability)</li>

                        <li>But legitimacy never converges (interpretive resistance persists)</li>

                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>This is not incomplete institutionalization or failed change. It&#x27;s a predictable
                        attractor when:</strong></p>

                    <ul>

                        <li>Enforcement mechanisms sustain behavior (monitoring, dependencies, consequences)</li>

                        <li>BUT the interpretive environment continues generating cues of illegitimacy (unfairness,
                            hypocrisy, misalignment across subunits)
                        </li>

                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>

                    <ul>

                        <li>Open office plans: Widely adopted, persistently hated</li>

                        <li>Performance reviews: Required everywhere, trusted nowhere</li>

                        <li>Return-to-office mandates: Enforced compliance, ongoing legitimacy conflict</li>

                        <li>Compliance training: Everyone does it, no one thinks it works</li>

                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Why this matters:</strong></p>

                    <p>Most organizational theory assumes behavioral stability implies legitimacy (&quot;if people keep
                        doing it, they must accept it&quot;). ICT shows this is false.</p>

                    <p><strong>Practices can become structurally remembered as routines of compliance before-and even
                        without-becoming legitimate as shared meaning.</strong></p>

                    <p>People learn &quot;this is required&quot; without ever learning &quot;this makes sense.&quot; The
                        structure that forms encodes &quot;how to survive this,&quot; not &quot;this is right.&quot;</p>

                    <p><strong>Measurement implication:</strong></p>

                    <p>Compliance metrics (adoption rates, usage statistics, behavioral observations) are insufficient
                        evidence of successful change. They measure coordination, not legitimacy.</p>

                    <p>To assess legitimacy, you need to examine discourse: How do people talk about the practice? Do
                        they justify it or just comply? Do they defend it or work around it?</p>

                    <p><strong>Intervention implication:</strong></p>

                    <p>If you&#x27;re observing contested equilibrium (high compliance + persistent resistance), adding
                        more enforcement won&#x27;t resolve legitimacy. You need to address the contradictory cues
                        across domains that prevent interpretive convergence.</p>

                    <hr>

                    <h2 id="scope-and-limitations">Scope and Limitations</h2>

                    <p>Interpretive Conditions Theory applies best to persistent patterns of behavior in human systems where interpretation, legitimacy, and learning operate over time.</p>

                    <h3>When ICT Applies</h3>

                    <p><strong>ICT is designed to explain within-organization dynamics:</strong></p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>How patterns form, persist, and change within a single organizational context</li>
                        <li>How legitimacy is learned through interpretation of conditions</li>
                        <li>How distributed memory emerges through coordinated enactment</li>
                        <li>Why behavioral compliance can occur without interpretive convergence</li>
                        <li>How practices can stabilize as contested equilibrium</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>The theory works when:</strong></p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Interpretation is possible</strong> – Actors have cognitive capacity to read cues and assess legitimacy</li>
                        <li><strong>Choice exists</strong> – Some meaningful range of response options, even if constrained</li>
                        <li><strong>Consequences are observable</strong> – People can learn from what happens when actions are taken</li>
                        <li><strong>Coordination matters</strong> – Patterns require some alignment across actors</li>
                        <li><strong>Time for learning</strong> – Repeated interactions allow distributed memory to form through overlapping experience</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>What ICT Does Not Explain</h3>

                    <p><strong>ICT deliberately does not attempt to explain:</strong></p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Field-level diffusion</strong> of practices across organizations (how &quot;best practices&quot; spread industry-wide)</li>
                        <li><strong>Industry-wide isomorphism</strong> or convergence (why organizations come to look alike)</li>
                        <li><strong>Societal-level institutionalization</strong> (how practices become taken-for-granted across entire societies)</li>
                        <li><strong>Purely physical impossibility</strong> or non-negotiable material constraint unrelated to social organization</li>
                        <li><strong>Momentary compliance under first-contact coercion</strong> (initial forced behavior before any learning occurs)</li>
                        <li><strong>Behavior in total institutions</strong> with continuous surveillance where interpretation becomes irrelevant</li>
                        <li><strong>The psychological origins of radical novelty</strong> or creativity (where entirely new patterns come from)</li>
                        <li><strong>Non-social or purely mechanical systems</strong> (machines, algorithms, physical processes)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>The Relationship Between ICT and Field-Level Institutional Theory</h3>

                    <p>Field-level phenomena—such as industry-wide adoption of practices, regulatory requirements, or professional norms—involve the same interpretive and constraint mechanisms ICT describes, but operating at a different level of analysis.</p>

                    <p><strong>Within organizations,</strong> regulatory requirements, professional norms, and competitor practices function as conditions (constraints and cues) that people interpret and respond to. ICT explains how these external conditions—along with internal ones—shape legitimacy interpretation and coordinated enactment.</p>

                    <p><strong>Across organizations (field-level),</strong> ICT does not explain how these conditions themselves emerge, diffuse, or become widespread. Why do certain regulatory requirements get adopted? How do professional norms form and spread across a profession? Why do industries converge on similar practices? These questions involve field-level dynamics (industry evolution, institutional entrepreneurship, political coalition-building) that ICT treats as background conditions rather than phenomena to be explained.</p>

                    <p><strong>ICT's contribution is explaining what happens inside organizations when these external and internal conditions are present</strong>—how they're interpreted, how responses coordinate into patterns, and why those patterns persist or change through continuous enactment.</p>

                    <p>For example, when a new regulatory requirement is introduced:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Field-level institutional theory explains how that requirement emerged and spread across organizations</li>
                        <li>ICT explains how people within a specific organization interpret that requirement, what legitimacy they assign to compliance, how they coordinate responses, and whether the practice stabilizes as genuinely legitimate or as contested equilibrium</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Both levels of analysis are valuable; ICT is deliberately scoped to the within-organization level.</p>

                    <h3>Boundary Cases Requiring Further Development</h3>

                    <p>Some contexts fall at the boundaries of ICT's scope and require additional theoretical specification:</p>

                    <p><strong>Crisis situations:</strong> Does legitimacy interpretation change under extreme time pressure? Do people revert to deeply learned patterns or break from them? How does interpretive space function when decisions must be immediate?</p>

                    <p><strong>Radical uncertainty:</strong> When cues are completely novel (unprecedented technology, situations with no historical parallel), how does interpretation work without distributed memory to draw upon?</p>

                    <p><strong>Cross-cultural contexts:</strong> Do the five domains operate universally, or are some culture-specific? How does legitimacy interpretation vary across national/cultural boundaries within multinational organizations?</p>

                    <p><strong>Extreme power asymmetries:</strong> At what level of power concentration does interpretation become largely irrelevant? When does coercion fully substitute for legitimacy-based coordination?</p>

                    <p><strong>Hybrid/remote organizations:</strong> How does distributed work (remote, asynchronous) affect cue visibility and distributed memory formation? Does physical co-location matter for pattern coordination?</p>

                    <p>These boundary cases represent opportunities for theoretical extension rather than limitations of the core framework.</p>

                    <h3>What ICT Is and Is Not</h3>

                    <p><strong>ICT is:</strong></p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>A <strong>diagnostic theory</strong> explaining why patterns persist and where influence accumulates</li>
                        <li>A <strong>process theory</strong> focused on continuous enactment rather than static structures</li>
                        <li>A <strong>within-organization theory</strong> deliberately scoped to local coordination dynamics</li>
                        <li>An <strong>interpretive theory</strong> that explains pattern formation through meaning-making</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>ICT is not:</strong></p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>A <strong>predictive theory</strong> that guarantees specific outcomes from interventions</li>
                        <li>A <strong>prescriptive theory</strong> that specifies optimal organizational designs</li>
                        <li>A <strong>comprehensive theory</strong> attempting to explain all organizational phenomena</li>
                        <li>A <strong>deterministic theory</strong> treating behavior as mechanically produced by conditions</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>The theory's value lies not in prediction or prescription, but in making visible the mechanisms through which persistent patterns emerge and are maintained—or how they might be changed—through the ongoing relationship between conditions, interpretation, and coordinated action.</p>

                    <h2 id="critiques-and-questions">Critiques and Questions</h2>


                    <p>Critics may argue that Interpretive Conditions Theory under-specifies the mechanics of power,
                        enforcement, and strategic action, particularly in contexts where authority is highly
                        centralized or coercive.</p>

                    <p>Others may question whether the theory can account for moments of rapid change driven by legal
                        rulings, political realignments, or technological disruption.</p>

                    <p><strong>Interpretive Conditions Theory responds that it is not a theory of power acquisition,
                        institutional engineering, or individual motivation.</strong></p>

                    <p>Instead, it explains how legitimacy and constraint shape collective response over time, and how
                        repeated responses stabilize into pattern through continuous coordinated enactment.</p>

                    <p>The theory is most useful for understanding persistence, resistance, backlash, and fragmentation
                        in human systems, and invites empirical testing in contexts where legitimacy and capacity appear
                        misaligned or where structural memory fails to predict behavior.</p>

                    <p><strong>On power:</strong></p>

                    <p>ICT acknowledges that some actors have greater capacity to shape conditions others respond to
                        (what the theory calls &quot;stewardship of conditions&quot;). However, even powerful actors
                        cannot simply impose legitimacy-they can enforce compliance, but interpretive convergence
                        requires cue alignment across domains.</p>

                    <p>Power matters most in determining:</p>

                    <ul>

                        <li>What gets monitored and enforced (affecting coordination tipping points)</li>

                        <li>What becomes visible or invisible (affecting cue availability)</li>

                        <li>Whose interpretations get amplified or suppressed (affecting coordination around which
                            pattern)
                        </li>

                    </ul>

                    <p>But power cannot directly create taken-for-grantedness. That requires coordinated enactment and
                        distributed learning over time.</p>

                    <h2 id="why-this-theory-matters">Why This Theory Matters</h2>


                    <p>Interpretive Conditions Theory offers a way to understand organizing by explaining how people in
                        systems respond to the conditions around them, independent of intent or plan.</p>

                    <p>It integrates communication theory, institutional theory, and process thinking to show how
                        legitimacy and constraint shape collective response over time, and how those responses stabilize
                        into pattern through continuous coordinated enactment.</p>

                    <p>Rather than asking leaders to control behavior or change mindsets, the theory reframes the
                        problem. It asks a simpler, harder question:</p>

                    <blockquote><p><strong>What is this system teaching people to do-and what is it making possible or
                        impossible?</strong></p></blockquote>

                    <p>That question-more than any directive-explains why patterns persist, why change efforts stall or
                        backfire, and how organizing unfolds over time.</p>

                    <p><strong>For practitioners:</strong></p>

                    <p>ICT provides a diagnostic framework for understanding why change isn&#x27;t happening:</p>

                    <ul>

                        <li>Are conditions actually different, or just the words?</li>

                        <li>Do cues across all five domains align, or are they contradictory?</li>

                        <li>Has coordination tipped but legitimacy remained contested?</li>

                        <li>Are people learning &quot;how to survive this&quot; rather than &quot;this makes sense&quot;?</li>

                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>For researchers:</strong></p>

                    <p>ICT offers testable propositions about when legitimacy converges versus remains contested, when
                        behavioral stability indicates taken-for-grantedness versus contested equilibrium, and how
                        distributed learning through coordinated enactment produces structural persistence.</p>

                    <h2 id="contributions">Contributions</h2>

                    <p>Interpretive Conditions Theory contributes a legitimacy-centered, processual account of
                        persistence in human systems by foregrounding how stabilized patterns of response function as
                        organizational memory formed through continuous coordinated enactment in response to interpreted
                        conditions.</p>

                    <p>This framing helps explain why patterns stabilize, resist change, and recur over time-even after
                        leadership changes, new strategies, or shifts in intent.</p>

                    <p><strong>Key theoretical contributions:</strong></p>

                    <p><strong>1. Distinguishes coordination from legitimacy</strong></p>

                    <p>Shows that behavioral stability can occur without interpretive convergence, producing contested
                        equilibrium as a stable organizational state.</p>

                    <p><strong>2. Specifies structure as continuous enactment</strong></p>

                    <p>Treats structures not as entities that persist independently, but as patterns that exist only
                        through ongoing reproduction by distributed actors with overlapping learned responses.</p>

                    <p><strong>3. Operationalizes the legitimacy-interpretation-memory loop</strong></p>

                    <p>Provides concrete mechanisms (domains of influence, cue correlation, distributed learning) for
                        how legitimacy is signaled, interpreted, and stabilized into pattern.</p>

                    <p><strong>4. Explains non-deterministic persistence</strong></p>

                    <p>Shows how patterns can persist through agency rather than despite it-people keep choosing
                        responses that recreate the pattern because conditions make those responses sensible.</p>

                    <p><strong>5. Positions contested equilibrium as predictable, not pathological</strong></p>

                    <p>Challenges the assumption that organizational patterns must eventually become taken-for-granted,
                        showing when and why legitimacy remains durably contested.</p>

                    <p>By explicitly linking legitimacy, interpretation, agency, and constraint in a recursive model of
                        persistence through coordinated enactment, the theory clarifies how everyday responses
                        accumulate into durable patterns without requiring continuous enforcement or assuming
                        individual-level bad faith.</p>

                    <p>It offers a non-deterministic account of leadership responsibility oriented toward shaping
                        conditions that influence what actions become legitimate and sustainable in lived practice.</p>

                    <p><strong>Its primary contribution is not new mechanisms, but a reordering and operationalization
                        that makes the legitimacy–interpretation–memory loop visible and actionable for diagnosing and
                        intervening in team and organization level change.</strong></p>

                    <h2 id="brief-example">A Brief Example</h2>


                    <p>An organization wants teams to experiment more. Leaders announce the change, provide training,
                        and emphasize innovation. Yet behavior does not shift.</p>

                    <p>From an Interpretive Conditions perspective, audit cues across the five domains:</p>

                    <p><strong>Norms &amp; Expectations:</strong> What actually happens when people try something new?
                    </p>

                    <ul>

                        <li>Are experiments celebrated or scrutinized?</li>

                        <li>Are &quot;failures&quot; treated as learning or career-limiting?</li>

                        <li>Do successful experiments lead to visibility and opportunity?</li>

                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Rules, Processes, &amp; Tools:</strong> What does the system make easy or difficult?</p>

                    <ul>

                        <li>Do approval processes require extensive justification before trying anything?</li>

                        <li>Are tools optimized for efficiency (making experimentation costly) or iteration (making it
                            cheap)?
                        </li>

                        <li>Are there protected resources (time, budget, space) for experiments?</li>

                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Data &amp; Feedback:</strong> What gets measured and reviewed?</p>

                    <ul>

                        <li>Do performance reviews emphasize experimentation or flawless execution?</li>

                        <li>Are metrics focused on efficiency (utilization, cycle time) or learning (experiments run,
                            insights generated)?
                        </li>

                        <li>What data is visible about experiments others have tried?</li>

                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Skills &amp; Knowledge:</strong> Can people actually do this?</p>

                    <ul>

                        <li>Have people been trained in rapid prototyping, hypothesis testing, learning from failure?
                        </li>

                        <li>Are there accessible examples and templates?</li>

                        <li>Can people observe successful experimentation by others?</li>

                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Motivation &amp; Values:</strong> Is this connected to what matters?</p>

                    <ul>

                        <li>Do promotions go to people who executed flawlessly or those who learned through
                            experimentation?
                        </li>

                        <li>Are bonuses tied to meeting targets (discouraging risk) or generating insights?</li>

                        <li>Do leaders visibly protect and reward people who experiment?</li>

                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>If the correlation pattern across domains says:</strong></p>

                    <ul>

                        <li>Leaders SAY &quot;innovate&quot; (words in one domain)</li>

                        <li>But tools make it costly (friction)</li>

                        <li>Metrics punish variation (efficiency focus)</li>

                        <li>Mistakes are discussed publicly (risk)</li>

                        <li>Promotions go to flawless executors (reward misalignment)</li>

                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Then the system is teaching:</strong> &quot;Innovation is espoused but not legitimate to
                        enact.&quot;</p>

                    <p>The structure that forms is risk-avoidance, regardless of what leaders say they want. People
                        respond to the correlation pattern, not the words.</p>

                    <p><strong>For change to occur:</strong></p>

                    <p>Conditions across domains must shift to make experimentation legitimate:</p>

                    <ul>

                        <li>Protect early experimenters from negative consequences</li>

                        <li>Create tools/processes that make trying things easy</li>

                        <li>Measure and celebrate learning, not just success</li>

                        <li>Train people in experimentation methods</li>

                        <li>Connect experimentation to advancement and rewards</li>

                    </ul>

                    <p>When cues align across domains, legitimacy can converge. When enough people enact the new
                        response (experimenting), and it gets repeated enough that distributed learning occurs (&quot;experimenting
                        here is safe and rewarded&quot;), the structure shifts.</p>

                    <p><strong>The pattern persists only through continuous reenactment.</strong> If conditions revert,
                        the pattern will too.</p>

                    <h3>When Encouragement Isn&#x27;t Enough</h3>

                    <p>Organizations often encourage behaviors they genuinely want to see-speaking up, taking
                        initiative, experimenting, or collaborating across boundaries. Leaders may communicate these
                        intentions clearly and repeatedly. Yet the behavior often fails to appear, or appears briefly
                        and then fades.</p>

                    <p>Interpretive Conditions Theory explains why encouragement alone is rarely sufficient.</p>

                    <p><strong>Consider a team where leaders regularly say, &quot;If you see a problem, raise
                        it.&quot;</strong></p>

                    <p>On the surface, this message signals openness. However, over time, other conditions may tell a
                        different story:</p>

                    <ul>

                        <li>When concerns are raised, meetings run long and other priorities get delayed</li>

                        <li>The person who spoke up is subtly labeled as &quot;difficult&quot; or &quot;not a team
                            player&quot;
                        </li>

                        <li>Issues raised are acknowledged but rarely result in visible action</li>

                        <li>Leaders become defensive or ask for extensive documentation before considering the concern
                        </li>

                        <li>People who stay quiet and execute are praised for being &quot;low-maintenance&quot;</li>

                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>No one explicitly discourages speaking up, but the system&#x27;s responses create cues
                        about risk and legitimacy.</strong></p>

                    <p>Eventually, team members stop raising concerns-not because they disagree with the message, but
                        because they have learned what the system actually rewards. Silence becomes the sensible
                        response.</p>

                    <p><strong>Each person learns through their own experience and observation:</strong></p>

                    <ul>

                        <li>&quot;I raised that process issue and nothing changed except people seemed annoyed&quot;
                        </li>

                        <li>&quot;Jamie questioned the timeline and got a reputation for being negative&quot;</li>

                        <li>&quot;In my review I was told to focus on solutions not problems&quot;</li>

                        <li>&quot;The people who get promoted never rock the boat&quot;</li>

                    </ul>

                    <p>When these distributed individual learnings overlap enough, coordinated pattern emerges: everyone
                        stays silent. The structure exists not in any policy or chart, but in the continuous enactment
                        of silent responses.</p>

                    <p><strong>Importantly, this pattern often persists even after leadership changes or new messaging
                        is introduced. The structure has already formed through distributed learning.</strong></p>

                    <p>New leaders arrive and say &quot;we really do want to hear concerns!&quot; But people have
                        learned otherwise through experience. Until conditions across domains actually shift-until
                        speaking up is protected, rewarded, connected to advancement, and results in visible action-the
                        pattern persists.</p>

                    <p><strong>Interpretive Conditions Theory highlights that people are not responding to what leaders
                        say they want; they are responding to what the system has taught them through correlated cues
                        across multiple domains.</strong></p>

                    <p>In this way, persistent silence reflects organizational memory continuously enacted, not
                        individual attitude or courage.</p>

                    <p><strong>This example illustrates a core insight of the theory:</strong></p>

                    <p>Behavior that appears resistant or irrational is often a rational response to the interpretive
                        conditions people face. To change behavior sustainably, leaders must look beyond messages and
                        intentions and examine the conditions-across all five domains-that continue to shape
                        interpretation through correlated cues.</p>

                        <dt><strong>Structures</strong></dt>

                        <dd>Patterns continuously recreated through coordinated action. Structures exist as distributed
                            memory (what people have collectively learned through overlapping experience) and persist
                            only through ongoing reenactment. Not objects or stored information, but observable
                            regularity in coordinated responses.

                    <dl>

                        <dt><strong>Distributed Memory</strong></dt>

                        <dd>What people have collectively learned, through overlapping experiences, about what responses
                            are legitimate, safe, or worthwhile. No single person holds &quot;the structure&quot;-everyone
                            holds fragments, and overlap creates apparent coherence and enables coordination.
                        </dd>

                    <dl>

                        <dt><strong>Coordination Tipping Point</strong></dt>

                        <dd>The threshold at which a practice becomes the easiest way to coordinate work, regardless of
                            whether it&#x27;s considered legitimate. Occurs through network effects, tool dependencies,
                            and process integration.
                        </dd>

                    <dl>

                        <dt><strong>Legitimacy Tipping Point</strong></dt>

                        <dd>The threshold at which a practice becomes taken-for-granted as sensible/appropriate. People
                            defend it even when it disadvantages them. Dissent becomes socially weird, not just
                            inconvenient.

                    <dl>

                        <dt><strong>Contested Equilibrium</strong></dt>

                        <dd>A stable state in which practices are routinely enacted (coordination has tipped) but
                            legitimacy remains persistently contested. Behavioral stability without interpretive
                            convergence. Not failed institutionalization but a predictable attractor when enforcement
                            sustains behavior while cue environments remain contradictory.
                        </dd>

                    </dl>

                    <dl>

                        <dt><strong>Change</strong></dt>

                        <dd>A shift in the conditions people respond to-particularly legitimacy cues across
                            domains-combined with coordinated enactment of new responses that, through repetition,
                            create new distributed memory. Not a declaration of goals, attitudes, or desired end states.
