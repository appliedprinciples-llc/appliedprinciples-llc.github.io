        <p><strong>How Legitimacy, Interpretation, and Memory Shape Organizing</strong><br>

        <h4 id="how-to-read-ict">How to Read Interpretive Conditions Theory</h4>

        <p>
          Interpretive Conditions Theory is an interpretive communication theory of organizing.
          Rather than predicting behavior or prescribing solutions, it explains how patterns of behavior emerge
          and persist in human systems.
        </p>

        <p>As you read, keep three things in mind:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>This theory explains patterns, not individuals.</strong><br />
            Interpretive Conditions Theory is not about why a particular person acts the way they do.
            It explains why certain behaviors become common, expected, or avoided across a system over time.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>“Conditions” are not attitudes or personalities.</strong><br />
            The theory focuses on external conditions people encounter-such as norms, rules, tools, feedback,
            and constraints-and how systems learn from repeated responses to those conditions.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Structure means “what the system has learned.”</strong><br />
            When the theory refers to structures, it does not mean org charts or formal rules.
            Structures are the stabilized patterns that remain after the same responses happen again and again.
            <p>
              This learning is displayed through what people come to take for granted: what questions are safe to ask,
              which risks are avoided, how decisions really get made, where work slows down, and what “everyone knows”
              without needing to say out loud. These shared understandings are not written anywhere, but they reliably
              guide behavior.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is what people often describe informally as culture-what you “just know” once you’ve been in a system
              long enough-but in Interpretive Conditions Theory, these patterns are treated as the visible evidence of what
              the system has learned from past responses, not as abstract values or attitudes.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          Read it as an explanation of how organizing works when people interpret their environment and respond to what
          feels legitimate, risky, or possible.
        </p>

        <p>
          As with many interpretive theories, the value of Interpretive Conditions Theory lies not in prediction,
          but in helping you see what is shaping behavior that might otherwise feel confusing or irrational.
        </p>

        <h4 id="theory">Theory</h4>

        <p>
        <strong>Interpretive Conditions Theory</strong> is an interpretive-institutional theory of organizing
        that explains persistent patterns of behavior as responses to conditions people interpret as legitimate,
        risky, or worthwhile over time. Rather than viewing organizations as systems that execute plans or
        individuals as actors who simply follow rules, this theory conceptualizes organizing as an ongoing process
        of interpretation and response shaped by environmental conditions.
      </p>

      <p>
        From this perspective, people do not primarily change behavior because they are instructed to do so or
        persuaded to adopt new attitudes. Instead, behavior emerges as a rational response to what the system has
        taught people-through experience-about what actions are safe, expected, rewarded, or punished. Over time,
        these responses stabilize into patterns that guide future behavior, even when original intentions or
        circumstances have changed.
      </p>

      <hr>

      <h4 id="core-assumptions">Core Assumptions</h4>
      <p>Interpretive Conditions Theory rests on five central assumptions:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Human systems are interpretive.</strong> People act based on how they interpret their environment, not on objective conditions alone.</li>
        <li><strong>Legitimacy precedes action.</strong> Before acting, individuals assess whether an action feels acceptable, risky, or worthwhile within the system.</li>
        <li><strong>Meaning is environmentally produced.</strong> Leaders and organizations cannot directly change beliefs or motivation; they shape the conditions people interpret.</li>
        <li><strong>Persistence is learned, not imposed.</strong> Stable patterns of behavior arise through repeated responses that become normalized over time.</li>
        <li><strong>Change is conditional, not declarative.</strong> Sustainable change occurs when the conditions people respond to shift, not when end states are announced.</li>
      </ol>

      <hr>

      <h4 id="key-concepts">Key Concepts</h4>

      <h5>Conditions</h5>
      <p>
        Conditions are the environmental features people encounter and interpret as they decide how to act.
        Interpretive Conditions Theory focuses exclusively on external, observable conditions, not internal states
        such as attitudes or personality.
      </p>
      <p>
        Conditions matter because they shape what actions feel legitimate or risky before conscious reasoning begins.
      </p>
      <p>
        Importantly, not all conditions shape behavior through interpretation alone. Some conditions constrain action
        directly by limiting what is possible, regardless of how an action is interpreted. Tool capabilities, budget
        limits, formal authority, legal requirements, and veto power all function as conditions that restrict action
        through capacity and permission, not meaning. Repeated responses to these constraints also stabilize into
        structure over time.
      </p>

        <h5>Legitimacy</h5>
        <p>
          Legitimacy refers to the shared sense of what actions are acceptable, safe, or worth the effort within a system. It is not limited to formal authority, legality, or moral approval. In Interpretive Conditions Theory, legitimacy describes how people judge whether an action “makes sense” given the risks, norms, constraints, and past responses of the system.
        </p>
        <p>
          Legitimacy is learned through experience. People infer it by observing what happens when certain actions are taken—what is rewarded, ignored, discouraged, or punished. Over time, these judgments stabilize into structure, shaping what actions feel possible without requiring explicit instruction or enforcement.
        </p>

      <h5>Domains of Influence</h5>
      <p>
        The theory identifies five domains of influence through which legitimacy is most commonly produced and reinforced:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Norms &amp; Expectations</strong> - what behavior is taken for granted, praised, ignored, or quietly penalized</li>
        <li><strong>Rules, Processes, &amp; Tools</strong> - formal and informal mechanisms that shape how work is done</li>
        <li><strong>Data &amp; Feedback</strong> - what information is visible, reviewed, and acted upon</li>
        <li><strong>Skills &amp; Knowledge</strong> - what the environment makes learnable, transferable, and usable</li>
        <li><strong>Motivation &amp; Values</strong> - what the system rewards, discourages, or makes meaningful</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These domains are not internal attributes; they are external conditions people respond to as they decide how to act.
        The domains are not intended to be exhaustive. They represent the most common and observable surfaces through which
        legitimacy and constraint are learned and reinforced in organizational systems. They function as a diagnostic lens,
        not a complete inventory of causal forces.
      </p>

      <h5>Cues</h5>
      <p>
        Cues are the observable signals people read from domains to infer legitimacy. Cues include leadership attention,
        patterns of reward and punishment, silence around certain topics, and consistency-or inconsistency-between words and actions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cues often operate implicitly. People may not be able to name them, but they reliably shape behavior by signaling what is safe
        or dangerous to attempt.
      </p>

      <h5>Interpretation and Response</h5>
      <p>
        Interpretation refers to the sensemaking process through which individuals assign meaning to cues. Response is the action that follows.
        Importantly, responses are often adaptive rather than intentional; people act in ways that align with what the system appears to reward
        or tolerate.
      </p>

      <h5>Structures as Organizational Memory</h5>
      <p>
        In Interpretive Conditions Theory, structures are not charts, plans, or designs. They are stabilized patterns of response that persist over time.
      </p>
      <p>
        When certain responses repeatedly lead to reward or safety, they become normalized. When responses lead to risk or punishment, they are avoided.
        Over time, the system "remembers" these patterns, and future behavior is shaped by this memory-even when original conditions have changed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Structures form not only through signals of legitimacy and risk, but also through repeated adaptation to constraint-such as workarounds,
        delays, or avoidance shaped by tool limits, authority boundaries, or resource restrictions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Structures thus function as organizational memory, constraining what actions feel possible without requiring constant enforcement.
      </p>

        <p>
          For instance, in many workplaces, official policies say that employees are encouraged to take time off or even that vacation is unlimited.
          Yet people quickly learn how much vacation is actually acceptable by watching who takes time off, how it’s discussed, and whether there
          are consequences afterward. Over time, employees “just know” how much absence is safe, regardless of what the policy states.
        </p>

      <h4 id="explaining-stability">Explaining Stability</h4>
      <p>
        The theory explains organizational stability as a consequence of learned interpretation, not resistance to change.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, a team that once experienced negative consequences for raising concerns may remain silent long after leadership changes.
        No one needs to enforce silence; the structure has already formed. The system continues to respond to what it has learned about risk.
      </p>

      <p>This explains why:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>change initiatives revert under pressure</li>
        <li>training fails to translate into practice</li>
        <li>"we tried that once" continues to carry weight</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Stability is not stubbornness; it is memory.</strong></p>

      <hr>

      <h4 id="explaining-change">Explaining Change</h4>
      <p>
        Change occurs when conditions shift sufficiently that different responses become legitimate.
      </p>
      <p>This may involve:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>altering feedback loops</li>
        <li>redistributing decision authority</li>
        <li>changing what is visible or invisible</li>
        <li>redefining success and failure</li>
        <li>reducing or redistributing risk</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Interpretive Conditions Theory does not promise predictable outcomes. People may still respond in unexpected ways.
        However, it asserts that without changing conditions, new behavior is unlikely to persist, regardless of intent or effort.
      </p>

      <hr>

      <h4 id="scope-and-limitations">Scope and Limitations</h4>
      <p>
        Interpretive Conditions Theory applies best to persistent patterns of behavior in human systems where interpretation, legitimacy,
        and learning operate over time.
      </p>
      <p>It does not seek to explain:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>purely physical impossibility or non-negotiable material constraint unrelated to social organization</li>
        <li>momentary compliance under first-contact coercion</li>
        <li>behavior in total institutions with continuous enforcement</li>
        <li>the psychological origins of radical novelty</li>
        <li>non-social or purely mechanical systems</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The theory is diagnostic rather than predictive. It explains why patterns persist and where influence accumulates,
        but it does not guarantee outcomes.
      </p>

      <hr>

      <h4 id="strengths">Strengths</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Integrates interpretation, legitimacy, constraint, and structure into a single explanatory loop</li>
        <li>Explains persistence and resistance to change without blaming individuals or assuming bad faith</li>
        <li>Accounts for why change efforts fail when legitimacy and capacity are misaligned</li>
        <li>Applies across scales, from teams and organizations to institutions and societies</li>
      </ul>

      <hr>

      <h4 id="critiques-and-questions">Critiques and Questions</h4>
      <p>
        Critics may argue that Interpretive Conditions Theory under-specifies the mechanics of power, enforcement, and strategic action,
        particularly in contexts where authority is highly centralized or coercive. Others may question whether the theory can account for
        moments of rapid change driven by legal rulings, political realignments, or technological disruption.
      </p>
      <p>
        Interpretive Conditions Theory responds that it is not a theory of power acquisition, institutional engineering, or individual motivation.
        Instead, it explains how legitimacy and constraint shape collective response over time, and how repeated responses stabilize into structure.
        The theory is most useful for understanding persistence, resistance, backlash, and fragmentation in human systems, and invites empirical
        testing in contexts where legitimacy and capacity appear misaligned or where structural memory fails to predict behavior.
      </p>

      <hr>

      <h4 id="why-this-theory-matters">Why This Theory Matters</h4>
      <p>
        Interpretive Conditions Theory offers a way to understand organizing by explaining how people in systems respond to the conditions around them, independent of intent or plan.
        It integrates communication theory, institutional theory, and systems thinking to show how legitimacy and constraint shape
        collective response over time, and how those responses stabilize into structure.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rather than asking leaders to control behavior or change mindsets, the theory reframes the problem. It asks a simpler, harder question:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><strong>What is this system teaching people to do-and what is it making possible or impossible?</strong></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        That question-more than any directive-explains why patterns persist, why change efforts stall or backfire, and how organizing unfolds over time.
      </p>

      <hr>

      <h4 id="contributions">Contributions</h4>
      <p>
        Interpretive Conditions Theory contributes a legitimacy-centered explanation of persistence in human systems by conceptualizing structures as
        organizational memory formed through repeated responses to environmental conditions. It integrates institutional legitimacy, sensemaking, and
        structuration into a single causal loop that explains why patterns stabilize, resist change, and reappear over time.
      </p>
      <p>
        By treating both interpretation and constraint as conditions that shape response, the theory explains persistence even in the absence of continuous
        enforcement. It offers a non-deterministic account of leadership responsibility grounded in the stewardship of conditions rather than the control of outcomes.

      <h4 id="brief-example">A Brief Example</h4>
      <p>
        An organization wants teams to experiment more. Leaders announce the change, provide training, and emphasize innovation.
        Yet behavior does not shift.
      </p>
      <p>From an Interpretive Conditions perspective:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>performance metrics still reward efficiency (Data &amp; Feedback)</li>
        <li>mistakes are discussed publicly (Norms &amp; Expectations)</li>
        <li>tools make experimentation costly (Rules, Processes, &amp; Tools)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The system continues to teach that speed is legitimate and risk is dangerous. Until those conditions change, behavior remains stable.
      </p>

      <hr>

      <h4 id="closer-look">A Closer Look</h4>
      <h5>When Encouragement Isn't Enough</h5>
      <p>
        Organizations often encourage behaviors they genuinely want to see-speaking up, taking initiative, experimenting, or collaborating across boundaries.
        Leaders may communicate these intentions clearly and repeatedly. Yet the behavior often fails to appear, or appears briefly and then fades.
        Interpretive Conditions Theory explains why encouragement alone is rarely sufficient.
      </p>
      <p>
        Consider a team where leaders regularly say, "If you see a problem, raise it." On the surface, this message signals openness. However, over time,
        other conditions may tell a different story. When concerns are raised, meetings run long, priorities shift away from the issue, or the person who
        spoke up is subtly labeled as "difficult" or "negative." No one explicitly discourages speaking up, but the system's responses create cues about risk and legitimacy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Eventually, team members stop raising concerns-not because they disagree with the message, but because they have learned what the system actually rewards.
        Silence becomes the sensible response. Importantly, this pattern often persists even after leadership changes or new messaging is introduced.
        The structure has already formed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Interpretive Conditions Theory highlights that people are not responding to what leaders say they want; they are responding to what the system has taught them is safe.
        In this way, persistent behavior reflects organizational memory rather than individual attitude or courage.
      </p>
      <p>
        This example illustrates a core insight of the theory: behavior that appears resistant or irrational is often a rational response to the interpretive conditions people face.
        To change behavior sustainably, leaders must look beyond messages and intentions and examine the conditions that continue to shape interpretation over time.

        <dl>
          <dt><strong>Interpretive Conditions Theory</strong></dt>
          <dd>An interpretive-institutional theory of organizing that explains persistent patterns of behavior as responses to conditions people interpret as legitimate, risky, or worthwhile over time.</dd>

          <dt><strong>Human Systems</strong></dt>
          <dd>Collectives in which coordination and stability emerge through ongoing interpretation and response rather than through direct control or compliance.</dd>

          <dt><strong>Conditions</strong></dt>
          <dd>External, observable features of the environment that people encounter and interpret when deciding how to act. Conditions shape meaning before conscious choice or intention.</dd>

          <dt><strong>Domains of Influence</strong></dt>
          <dd>Key areas through which conditions produce and reinforce legitimacy in a system: Norms &amp; Expectations; Rules, Processes, &amp; Tools; Data &amp; Feedback; Skills &amp; Knowledge; Motivation &amp; Values.</dd>

          <dt><strong>Cues</strong></dt>
          <dd>Observable signals drawn from conditions that indicate what actions are legitimate, risky, or worthwhile.</dd>

          <dt><strong>Interpretation</strong></dt>
          <dd>The sensemaking process through which individuals assess cues and determine what actions make sense within the system.</dd>

          <dt><strong>Response</strong></dt>
          <dd>The actions people take-or avoid-based on their interpretation of legitimacy and risk.</dd>

          <dt><strong>Structures</strong></dt>
          <dd>Stabilized patterns of response that persist over time and shape future behavior; organizational memory, not formal designs.</dd>

          <dt><strong>Legitimacy</strong></dt>
          <dd>The perceived acceptability or appropriateness of an action within a system, shaping what people feel able to do regardless of formal permission.</dd>

          <dt><strong>Change</strong></dt>
          <dd>A shift in the conditions people respond to-particularly legitimacy cues-rather than a declaration of goals, attitudes, or desired end states.</dd>
