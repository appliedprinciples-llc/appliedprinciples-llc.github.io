                    <p><strong>How Legitimacy, Interpretation, and Memory Shape Organizing</strong><br>
                        Matthew Carlson</p>

                    <h2 id="how-to-read-interpretive-conditions-theory">How to Read Interpretive Conditions Theory</h2>

                    <p>Interpretive Conditions Theory is an interpretive communication theory of organizing. Rather than
                        predicting behavior or prescribing solutions, it explains how patterns of behavior emerge and
                        persist in human systems.</p>

                    <p>As you read, keep three things in mind:</p>

                    <p><strong>1. This theory explains patterns, not individuals.</strong></p>

                    <p><strong>2. "Conditions" are not attitudes or personalities.</strong></p>

                    <p>The theory focuses on external conditions people encounter—such as norms, rules, tools, feedback,
                        and constraints—and how systems learn from repeated responses to those conditions.</p>

                    <p><strong>3. "Structure" means patterns continuously recreated through action, not organizational
                        charts or formal designs.</strong></p>

                    <p>Think of structure the way you think of language. English doesn't exist stored somewhere—it
                        exists only in the continuous practice of speaking and writing it. No single person knows all of
                        English. Each person holds fragments: vocabulary, grammar patterns, idioms they use. It "exists"
                        as structure only because enough people enact overlapping-enough patterns that mutual
                        intelligibility emerges.</p>

                    <p>If everyone stopped speaking English tomorrow, it would cease to exist as a living structure. New
                        speakers learn it by participating, not by accessing some stored "English object."</p>

                    <p><strong>Organizational structures work the same way.</strong> What we call "the culture" or "how
                        things work here" exists only in continuous enactment. Each person holds fragments—what they've
                        learned about what's legitimate, safe, or worthwhile. When enough people enact overlapping
                        patterns, it feels like a shared structure. But that structure persists only through ongoing
                        reproduction. If people stopped enacting it, it would dissolve.</p>

                    <p>This learning is displayed through what people come to take for granted: what questions are safe
                        to ask, which risks are avoided, how decisions really get made, where work slows down, and what
                        "everyone knows" without needing to say out loud. These shared understandings aren't written
                        anywhere, but they reliably guide behavior.</p>

                    <p>This is what people often describe informally as culture—what you "just know" once you've been in
                        a system long enough—but in Interpretive Conditions Theory, these patterns are treated as
                        visible evidence of what the system has learned from past responses, rather than taking stated
                        values or attitudes as the primary explanatory driver.</p>

                    <p>Read Interpretive Conditions Theory as an explanation of how organizing works when people
                        interpret their environment and respond to what feels legitimate, risky, or possible—and how
                        those responses, repeated and overlapping, create patterns that persist only through continuous
                        reenactment.</p>

                    <p>As with many interpretive theories, the value of Interpretive Conditions Theory lies not in
                        prediction, but in helping you see what is shaping behavior that might otherwise feel confusing
                        or irrational.</p>

                    <h2 id="theory">Theory</h2>

                    <p><strong>Interpretive Conditions Theory</strong> is an interpretive-institutional theory of
                        organizing that explains persistent patterns of behavior as responses to conditions people
                        interpret as legitimate, risky, or worthwhile over time. Rather than viewing organizations as
                        systems that execute plans or individuals as actors who simply follow rules, the theory
                        conceptualizes organizing as an ongoing process of interpretation and response shaped by
                        environmental conditions.</p>

                    <p>Interpretive Conditions Theory treats people as active agents who interpret and respond to
                        conditions, exercising agency within constraints rather than responding as if behavior were
                        mechanically determined.</p>

                    <p>In Interpretive Conditions Theory, organizing unfolds through a recurring dynamic: conditions
                        shape what is visible and possible; legitimacy orients what actions make sense; agency
                        determines how people respond; and repeated responses create patterns that guide future
                        behavior.</p>

                    <p>From this perspective, people do not primarily change behavior because they are instructed to do
                        so or persuaded to adopt new attitudes. Instead, behavior often emerges as a locally sensible
                        response to what the system has taught people—through experience—about which actions are safe,
                        expected, rewarded, or punished. Over time, these responses stabilize into patterns that guide
                        future behavior, even when original intentions or circumstances have changed.</p>

                    <hr>

                    <h2 id="core-assumptions">Core Assumptions</h2>

                    <p>Interpretive Conditions Theory rests on five central assumptions:</p>

                    <p><strong>1. Human systems are interpretive and agentic.</strong></p>

                    <p>People actively interpret their environment and choose how to respond to it; they are not
                        components reacting automatically to system design.</p>

                    <p><strong>2. Legitimacy orients action.</strong></p>

                    <p>In most organizational settings, people are more likely to take (or avoid) actions that feel
                        acceptable, safe, or worthwhile given the system's cues—often implicitly rather than through
                        conscious deliberation.</p>

                    <p><strong>3. Meaning is environmentally produced.</strong></p>

                    <p>Leaders rarely change beliefs or motivation reliably through messaging alone; what they can shape
                        more consistently are the conditions people interpret and respond to.</p>

                    <p><strong>4. Persistence is learned, not imposed.</strong></p>

                    <p>Stable patterns of behavior arise through repeated responses that become normalized over
                        time.</p>

                    <p><strong>5. Change is conditional, not declarative.</strong></p>

                    <p>Sustainable change occurs when the conditions people respond to shift, not when end states are
                        announced.</p>

                    <hr>

                    <h2 id="understanding-structure-as-process">Understanding Structure as Process</h2>

                    <p>Before exploring the key concepts, it's essential to understand what Interpretive Conditions
                        Theory means by "structure," because it differs from how the term is typically used.</p>

                    <h3>Structures Don't Exist—Structuring Exists</h3>

                    <p>Most organizational thinking treats structures as things: org charts, policies, systems, "the
                        culture." These are treated as if they exist independently and influence people's behavior.</p>

                    <p><strong>Interpretive Conditions Theory takes a different view:</strong></p>

                    <p><strong>Structures are not things. They are patterns that exist only in continuous coordinated
                        enactment.</strong></p>

                    <p>Consider how a path forms through snow. The first person makes tracks. The second finds it easier
                        to follow those tracks. Eventually a visible path forms—but only because people keep walking it.
                        If everyone stops using it, the next snowfall erases it. The path "remembers" where people
                        walked, but only as long as walking continues.</p>

                    <p>Organizational structures work the same way. They persist not because they're stored somewhere,
                        but because people continue to enact learned responses. When we say "the structure" persists,
                        what we mean is: <strong>people keep recreating the pattern.</strong></p>

                    <h3>Memory Is Distributed, Not Stored</h3>

                    <p>When ICT talks about "organizational memory," it doesn't mean information stored in a database or
                        written in policies.</p>

                    <p><strong>It means: what people have collectively learned through overlapping experiences about
                        what responses are legitimate, safe, or worthwhile.</strong></p>

                    <p>No one person holds "the structure." Everyone holds fragments:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>What I've learned happens when I speak up</li>
                        <li>What I've observed happens to others who tried something new</li>
                        <li>What consequences I've experienced when I broke a rule</li>
                        <li>What I've been rewarded for, ignored for, or punished for</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>When enough people have learned overlapping patterns—when our fragments align enough—it creates
                        mutual intelligibility. We can coordinate. The pattern feels real and shared.</p>

                    <p><strong>But it exists nowhere except in our continuous coordinated enactment of those learned
                        responses.</strong></p>

                    <h3>Multiple Structures Operate Simultaneously</h3>

                    <p>Each person navigates multiple structures at any given moment:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Work structures (organizational norms, team practices, professional identity)</li>
                        <li>Family structures (household routines, parenting patterns, relationship dynamics)</li>
                        <li>Community structures (neighborhood expectations, civic participation)</li>
                        <li>National/cultural structures (language, holidays, taken-for-granted social norms)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>These aren't separate "parts of life." They're different pattern-contexts, each with its own
                        legitimacy rules, that you're constantly assessing and switching between:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>You don't talk to your boss the same way you talk to your kids</li>
                        <li>What's funny at home might be inappropriate at work</li>
                        <li>What's efficient with your team might be rude with your spouse</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>At any moment, multiple structures are potentially relevant.</strong></p>

                    <p>When your boss texts at 8pm, which structure applies? Work or family time? The ambiguity creates
                        interpretive difficulty because multiple structures are simultaneously active, each suggesting
                        different responses.</p>

                    <p><strong>Organizational change often fails because it assumes people operate in a single
                        structure.</strong> In reality, people are navigating multiple overlapping structures, and the
                        new organizational pattern may conflict with family structures, professional identity
                        structures, or community structures that are equally real and consequential.</p>

                    <h3>Structures Persist Through Reenactment, Not Inertia</h3>

                    <p>Because structures exist only in continuous doing, they require ongoing reproduction to
                        persist.</p>

                    <p><strong>This has profound implications:</strong></p>

                    <p><strong>Change doesn't require "overcoming" structure.</strong> It requires coordinated shifts in
                        enactment. If people stop recreating the old pattern and start enacting a different one—and do
                        so consistently enough that overlap emerges—a new structure forms.</p>

                    <p><strong>Stability doesn't mean resistance.</strong> It means people keep finding the learned
                        response sensible, safe, or worthwhile given the conditions they're interpreting. The pattern
                        persists because it's continuously recreated, not because it's stored somewhere preventing
                        change.</p>

                    <p><strong>"Strong cultures" aren't hard to change because they're deeply embedded.</strong> They're
                        hard to change because many people have learned deeply overlapping patterns, making coordination
                        around a new pattern difficult. But if conditions shift enough that coordinated enactment
                        shifts, even deeply learned structures can dissolve surprisingly quickly.</p>

                    <h3>Conditions</h3>

                    <p><strong>Conditions are the environmental features people encounter and interpret as they decide
                        how to act.</strong></p>

                    <p>Interpretive Conditions Theory prioritizes external, observable conditions—norms, rules, tools,
                        feedback, constraints—as the primary analytic entry point, rather than modeling internal traits
                        such as personality.</p>

                    <p>Conditions matter because they shape what actions feel legitimate or risky, often prior to or
                        alongside explicit deliberation.</p>

                    <p><strong>Importantly, not all conditions shape behavior through interpretation alone.</strong>
                        Some conditions constrain action directly by limiting what is possible, regardless of how an
                        action is interpreted:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Tool capabilities limit what can be done</li>
                        <li>Budget limits restrict options</li>
                        <li>Formal authority determines permissions</li>
                        <li>Legal requirements create boundaries</li>
                        <li>Veto power constrains choices</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>These function as conditions that restrict action through <strong>capacity and
                        permission</strong>, not just meaning.</p>

                    <p>However, repeated responses to these constraints also stabilize into structure over time. People
                        learn workarounds, develop informal processes, or simply accept limitations as "how things
                        are."</p>

                    <p><strong>Crucially, conditions are both input and output in a recursive loop:</strong></p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Conditions shape how people interpret what's legitimate</li>
                        <li>People respond based on those interpretations</li>
                        <li>Repeated responses create new conditions (patterns others observe and respond to)</li>
                        <li>These new conditions shape the next round of interpretation</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>This recursion is why organizational change is challenging: structures are simultaneously the
                        environment people respond to AND the outcome of those responses.</p>

                    <h3>Legitimacy</h3>

                    <p><strong>Legitimacy refers to the shared sense of what actions are acceptable, safe, or worth the
                        effort within a system.</strong></p>

                    <p>It is not limited to formal authority, legality, or moral approval. In Interpretive Conditions
                        Theory, legitimacy describes how people judge whether an action "makes sense" given the risks,
                        norms, constraints, and past responses of the system.</p>

                    <p><strong>Legitimacy is learned through experience.</strong> People infer it by observing what
                        happens when certain actions are taken—what is rewarded, ignored, discouraged, or punished. Over
                        time, these judgments stabilize into pattern, shaping what actions feel possible without
                        requiring explicit instruction or enforcement.</p>

                    <p><strong>Legitimacy operates across a spectrum:</strong></p>

                    <p><strong>Contested legitimacy:</strong> Actions require explicit justification or deliberation.
                        "Should I do this? What will happen?" This is where most organizational change lives.</p>

                    <p><strong>Routine legitimacy:</strong> Actions are normal and expected but still conscious. "This
                        is what we do here."</p>

                    <p><strong>Taken-for-granted legitimacy:</strong> Actions are so obvious that alternatives aren't
                        considered. "Of course we do it this way." This is legitimacy's most powerful state—when it
                        becomes invisible.</p>

                    <p><strong>Critical insight: Legitimacy is phenomenological, relational, and institutional
                        simultaneously.</strong></p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Phenomenological:</strong> A felt sense of whether an action is worth the likely
                            consequence
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Relational:</strong> How meanings are negotiated, reinforced, or corrected in
                            interaction with others
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Institutional:</strong> When action becomes obvious and legitimacy collapses into
                            structure—enacted without thought
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Agency</h3>

                    <p><strong>Agency refers to the capacity of people to choose how they respond to conditions, even
                        when options are constrained.</strong></p>

                    <p>In Interpretive Conditions Theory, individuals are not passive recipients of structure; they
                        interpret, comply, resist, adapt, and improvise based on what feels legitimate, risky, or
                        possible.</p>

                    <p><strong>Agency does not imply unlimited freedom.</strong> It is always exercised within
                        conditions and constraints.</p>

                    <p><strong>But here's the critical connection to structure:</strong></p>

                    <p><strong>Agency is HOW structures are recreated or changed.</strong></p>

                    <p>Every moment of interpretation and response is an opportunity for:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Reproducing the existing pattern</strong> (structure persists through reenactment)
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Slight variation</strong> (structure evolves gradually)</li>
                        <li><strong>Violation</strong> (structure is tested; what happens reveals its strength)</li>
                        <li><strong>Coordinated change</strong> (structure dissolves or transforms when enough people
                            enact differently)
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Over time, the cumulative exercise of agency—millions of small choices about how to
                        respond—shapes and reshapes patterns. These patterns, when they become reliably coordinated, are
                        what we call structures.</p>

                    <p><strong>This means structures don't constrain agency in the traditional sense.</strong> Rather,
                        structures are the accumulated outcome of agency exercised under past conditions, now
                        functioning as conditions for the next round of interpretation and response.</p>

                    <h3>Domains of Influence</h3>

                    <p>The theory identifies six domains through which organizational patterns are shaped and learned,
                        operating at two distinct levels:</p>

                    <p><strong>Five Structural/Environmental Domains</strong> (organizational level):</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Data & Feedback</strong> – what information is visible, reviewed, and acted upon
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Tools & Processes</strong> – formal and informal mechanisms that shape how work is
                            done
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Capacity</strong> – what people have the time, authority, energy, and structural
                            position to accomplish
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Skills & Knowledge</strong> – what the environment makes learnable, transferable,
                            and usable
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Motivation & Values</strong> – what the system rewards, discourages, or makes
                            meaningful
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>One Collective Interpretation Domain</strong> (social/peer level):</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Norms & Expectations</strong> – what behavior is taken for granted, praised,
                            ignored, or quietly penalized; what "people like me" do; what stories circulate
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>How Structural Domains Shape Patterns: Three Mechanisms</strong></p>

                    <p>The five structural domains don't merely exist as background conditions. They actively shape
                        organizational patterns through three interconnected mechanisms:</p>

                    <p><strong>1. Structural Mechanism: Enabling and Constraining Action</strong></p>

                    <p>Each domain makes certain actions possible or impossible through its design and allocation:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Data & Feedback:</strong> What's measured can be tracked and improved; what's
                            invisible remains unmanaged
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Tools & Processes:</strong> System capabilities determine what's feasible; approval
                            workflows gate action
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Capacity:</strong> Time, authority, and resources determine what's structurally
                            possible
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Skills & Knowledge:</strong> What people know how to do determines accessible
                            options
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Motivation & Values:</strong> Consequences shape which actions feel worth attempting
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>When domains create hard constraints—no time, no tool capability, no authority—coordination
                        becomes impossible regardless of intent.</p>

                    <p><strong>2. Signaling Mechanism: Revealing Priorities and Legitimacy</strong></p>

                    <p>Domains don't just enable or constrain—their allocation and design signal what truly matters:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Data & Feedback:</strong> What gets measured signals importance; what's tracked in
                            reviews signals career impact
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Tools & Processes:</strong> What receives tooling investment signals priorities;
                            what's automated vs. manual signals value
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Capacity:</strong> How time and authority are allocated reveals actual priorities,
                            often contradicting verbal commitments
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Skills & Knowledge:</strong> What training is funded signals where the organization
                            expects people to develop
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Motivation & Values:</strong> What leads to advancement reveals true values,
                            regardless of stated culture
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>This signaling function explains why capacity constraints are so revealing: they show where
                        organizations actually invest time, money, and authority—which often contradicts what leaders
                        say matters.</p>

                    <p><strong>3. Cognitive Mechanism: Shaping What's Thinkable</strong></p>

                    <p>Perhaps most subtly, structural domains shape cognition by providing the interpretive frames
                        through which people understand situations and imagine possibilities.</p>

                    <p><strong>Tools & Processes</strong> provide language, categories, and mental models:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Organizations using Jira think in "stories," "epics," and "sprints"</li>
                        <li>Organizations using Azure DevOps think in "work items," "boards," and "releases"</li>
                        <li>Organizations using physical kanban think in "flow," "WIP limits," and "cycle time"</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>You can often detect which tools an organization uses before seeing them, simply by listening to
                        how people talk about work. The tool hasn't just enabled certain workflows—it has shaped what
                        concepts are available, what breakdowns feel natural, what people can easily visualize.</p>

                    <p><strong>Data & Feedback</strong> shapes attention and what constitutes evidence:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>What's measured becomes salient; unmeasured phenomena fade from awareness</li>
                        <li>Available metrics determine what questions can be answered</li>
                        <li>Dashboards shape what comparisons feel natural</li>
                        <li>"Data-driven" decisions are constrained by what data exists</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Capacity</strong> shapes time horizons and perceived possibility:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Chronic overload trains people to think short-term; long-horizon planning feels
                            unrealistic
                        </li>
                        <li>Never experiencing slack time makes slack-dependent activities (reflection, exploration,
                            relationship building) cognitively unavailable
                        </li>
                        <li>Authority boundaries shape what feels "within scope" vs. "not my domain"</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Skills & Knowledge</strong> shapes problem recognition and solution space:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>If you don't know technique X exists, you can't recognize situations where X would help</li>
                        <li>Training in particular methodologies shapes what problems are visible</li>
                        <li>Professional socialization shapes what feels like "real work" vs. auxiliary activity</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Motivation & Values</strong> shapes what opportunities are noticed:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>You see what you're primed to care about</li>
                        <li>Reward structures shape what feels like "winning" vs. "losing"</li>
                        <li>What's celebrated in stories shapes aspirational identity</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Why the cognitive mechanism matters:</strong></p>

                    <p>The cognitive function explains why changing structural domains can feel so disorienting. It's
                        not just that new behaviors are required—<strong>new ways of thinking become necessary.</strong>
                        When an organization switches from measuring "velocity" to measuring "cycle time," people must
                        reconceptualize what constitutes progress. The language shifts, the mental models shift, and
                        what feels like "doing well" shifts.</p>

                    <p>This is also why contradictory domains create confusion beyond simple mixed signals: they create
                        <strong>cognitive dissonance</strong>. When leaders say "take time to innovate" (verbal message)
                        but maintain 100% utilization (capacity allocation), people experience not just conflicting
                        signals but conflicting frames. The time-scarcity frame makes innovation cognitively difficult
                        to envision, even when verbally encouraged.</p>

                    <p><strong>The Three Mechanisms Work Together</strong></p>

                    <p>Structural domains exert influence through all three mechanisms simultaneously:</p>

                    <p>A capacity constraint (100% utilization) doesn't just prevent experimentation (structural) and
                        signal that other work matters more (legitimacy)—it also shapes people to think short-term and
                        makes long-horizon exploration cognitively unavailable (cognitive).</p>

                    <p>A tool choice (Jira vs. kanban) doesn't just enable certain workflows (structural) and signal
                        priorities through investment (legitimacy)—it also provides the language and mental models
                        through which work is understood (cognitive).</p>

                    <p>This triple mechanism explains why structural changes are so powerful: they don't just change
                        what's possible and what's valued—they change what's thinkable.</p>

                    <p><strong>The Collective Interpretation Domain: A Different Mechanism</strong></p>

                    <p><strong>Norms & Expectations</strong> operates fundamentally differently from the five structural
                        domains. While structural domains are designed, allocated, and controlled by those with
                        organizational authority, <strong>Norms emerges from collective interpretation through social
                            interaction.</strong></p>

                    <p>Norms & Expectations represents the social layer where peer-to-peer interpretation occurs:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Stories people tell about what happened to colleagues</li>
                        <li>Informal signals about what's socially acceptable</li>
                        <li>Identity-based expectations ("what people like me do here")</li>
                        <li>Informal sanctions and social belonging cues</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Norms functions recursively:</strong></p>

                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>As observable input:</strong> Peer signals, stories, identity markers that
                            individuals encounter
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>As emergent process:</strong> Collective sense-making as people compare experiences
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>As outcome:</strong> The stabilized pattern of distributed memory when
                            interpretations converge
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>As input again:</strong> That pattern becomes a condition newcomers encounter</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p><strong>Unlike structural domains, Norms:</strong></p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Is constituted through interaction, not provided by organizational design</li>
                        <li>Emerges from collective interpretation; cannot be mandated</li>
                        <li>Functions recursively as both input and outcome</li>
                        <li>Represents legitimacy itself at the collective level, not just a signal</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Examples of normative phenomena that don't fit in structural domains:</strong></p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>"Remember what happened to Jamie when they questioned the timeline?" (story that teaches
                            risk)
                        </li>
                        <li>"Everyone leaves at 7pm but nobody talks about it" (unspoken social norm)</li>
                        <li>"Real engineers here solve problems, they don't raise problems" (identity-based
                            expectation)
                        </li>
                        <li>"People who use all their vacation are seen as uncommitted" (informal sanction)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>These exist only in social interaction. Organizations cannot design them directly, only influence
                        them indirectly by shaping the structural domains from which normative patterns emerge.</p>

                    <p><strong>In institutional theory terms:</strong> Norms & Expectations is where legitimacy
                        ultimately resides. The five structural domains create conditions that influence whether
                        legitimacy converges, but convergence happens at the collective level through normative
                        alignment. When practices achieve "taken-for-granted" status (Meyer & Rowan, 1977; Zucker,
                        1977), that taken-for-grantedness lives in Norms & Expectations.</p>

                    <p><strong>Framework Foundations: Gilbert and Institutional Theory</strong></p>

                    <p>This framework draws on Gilbert's (1978) Behavior Engineering Model while extending it in three
                        critical ways:</p>

                    <p><strong>First,</strong> Gilbert distinguished between environmental support (information,
                        instrumentation, motivation) and individual repertory (knowledge, capacity, motives). ICT
                        recognizes that what Gilbert treated as "individual capacity" often reflects organizational
                        capacity allocation—system-level decisions about time, authority, and resources.</p>

                    <p><strong>Second,</strong> Gilbert focused on performance optimization ("what environmental
                        supports enable worthy performance?"). ICT reframes environmental factors as signals and
                        cognitive frames ("what environmental cues teach people what responses are legitimate and shape
                        what's thinkable?").</p>

                    <p><strong>Third,</strong> Gilbert's framework operated at the individual-organization interface.
                        ICT adds the collective interpretation layer (Norms & Expectations), recognizing that legitimacy
                        ultimately resides not in individual assessment but in collective, socially-negotiated sense of
                        what's taken-for-granted. This addition connects performance engineering to institutional
                        theory's core insight: practices become institutionalized when they achieve taken-for-granted
                        status through collective enactment.</p>

                    <p><strong>Domain Alignment and Legitimacy Convergence</strong></p>

                    <p><strong>These domains represent analytically distinct categories of environmental and social cues
                        through which legitimacy is signaled and learned.</strong></p>

                    <p>When people decide "Is this action legitimate here, and is it possible?", they're triangulating
                        across multiple types of cues:</p>

                    <p><strong>Structural signals:</strong></p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Data & Feedback:</strong> Will this show up in my review? Does anyone track it?</li>
                        <li><strong>Tools & Processes:</strong> Do systems support it? Can I even do this with our
                            tools? What does the tool make me think about?
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Capacity:</strong> Do I have time? Am I authorized? Does capacity allocation signal
                            this matters?
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Skills & Knowledge:</strong> Do I know how? Has the organization invested in
                            teaching this?
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Motivation & Values:</strong> Is it connected to advancement, bonuses, recognition?
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Collective interpretation:</strong></p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Norms & Expectations:</strong> Do people like me do this? What stories circulate?
                            What does this mean for my identity/belonging?
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>When structural domains align—cues across all five point consistently in the same
                        direction—AND when normative signals converge, legitimacy reaches taken-for-granted
                        status:</strong></p>

                    <p>"Yes, this is obviously what we do here. All signals confirm it, it's structurally possible, I
                        can think about it clearly, and everyone like me does it."</p>

                    <p><strong>When structural domains align BUT norms resist:</strong></p>

                    <p>"The organization supports this structurally, but peers signal it's not what people like me do
                        here."</p>

                    <p><strong>When structural domains contradict each other:</strong></p>

                    <p>"Leaders say they want X, but measurement, tools, capacity allocation, training investment, and
                        rewards all contradict this. I can't even think clearly about what X would look like in
                        practice."</p>

                    <p><strong>When capacity constrains despite other structural alignment:</strong></p>

                    <p>"This would be legitimate if possible, but there's no time/authority—AND the tolerance of this
                        impossibility signals it's not actually legitimate despite verbal claims."</p>

                    <p><strong>Practical Application: Auditing All Six Domains</strong></p>

                    <p>For any change initiative, audit across two levels:</p>

                    <p><strong>Structural level (can leadership directly change?):</strong></p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Data & Feedback:</strong> Does measurement reinforce the practice? What signals does
                            tracking send?
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Tools & Processes:</strong> Do systems enable it? What language/concepts do tools
                            provide?
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Capacity:</strong> Is time/authority available? What does allocation signal?</li>
                        <li><strong>Skills & Knowledge:</strong> Is training provided? What expertise is developed?</li>
                        <li><strong>Motivation & Values:</strong> Is it connected to advancement and recognition?</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Collective level (can only influence indirectly):</strong></p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Norms & Expectations:</strong> What stories circulate? What do peers signal? What
                            happens to early adopters?
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Common diagnostic patterns:</strong></p>

                    <p><strong>Pattern 1: Structural contradiction</strong></p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Domains send conflicting signals</li>
                        <li>Result: Confusion, scattered attempts, no pattern formation</li>
                        <li>Intervention: Align structural cues</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Pattern 2: Capacity-constrained</strong></p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Other structural domains align positively</li>
                        <li>But persistent capacity constraints block action</li>
                        <li>Tolerance of constraints signals true priorities</li>
                        <li>Result: High verbal support, zero behavior, misdiagnosed as motivation problem</li>
                        <li>Intervention: Create actual capacity AND address what tolerance signals</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Pattern 3: Normative resistance</strong></p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Structural domains align</li>
                        <li>But peer signals, stories, identity markers contradict</li>
                        <li>Result: Scattered adoption by "non-conformists," majority resistance</li>
                        <li>Intervention: Influence normative layer through visible early adopter protection, new
                            stories
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Pattern 4: Cognitive mismatch</strong></p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Tools/metrics provide frames incompatible with desired practice</li>
                        <li>Result: People can't think clearly about what's being asked</li>
                        <li>Intervention: Change tools/metrics to enable appropriate conceptualization</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Domain Weighting and Interaction: Theoretical Propositions</strong></p>

                    <p>The relative influence of each domain on legitimacy convergence and coordination stability is an
                        empirical question requiring further investigation. However, theoretical and empirical
                        foundations suggest several testable propositions:</p>

                    <p><strong>Proposition 1: Environmental support domains exert stronger influence on coordination
                        stability than individual repertory domains.</strong></p>

                    <p>Gilbert's (1978) finding that environmental factors account for approximately 75% of performance
                        variance suggests that Data & Feedback, Tools & Processes, and Capacity may have
                        disproportionate influence on whether practices become behaviorally enacted. These domains
                        directly constrain or enable action through structural mechanisms.</p>

                    <p><strong>Proposition 2: Norms & Expectations exerts the strongest influence on legitimacy
                        convergence.</strong></p>

                    <p>Institutional theory's emphasis on taken-for-grantedness as the marker of full
                        institutionalization (Tolbert & Zucker, 1996) suggests that collective interpretation—what
                        becomes "normal"—may be the primary driver of whether practices move from contested to routine
                        to taken-for-granted legitimacy.</p>

                    <p><strong>Proposition 3: Different domains weight differently for coordination versus
                        legitimacy.</strong></p>

                    <p>Because coordination stability and legitimacy convergence can decouple (producing contested
                        equilibrium), domains may have differential effects:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Coordination-dominant domains:</strong> Tools & Processes (hard dependencies), Data
                            & Feedback (monitoring), Capacity (structural enablement)
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Legitimacy-dominant domains:</strong> Norms & Expectations (collective meaning),
                            Motivation & Values (worthwhileness), Skills & Knowledge (confidence/mastery)
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>This suggests that:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Practices can achieve coordination stability through consistency in coordination-dominant
                            domains even when legitimacy-dominant domains remain contradictory
                        </li>
                        <li>Practices can have high legitimacy in principle (consistency in legitimacy-dominant domains)
                            while failing to achieve behavioral enactment (misalignment in coordination-dominant
                            domains)
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Proposition 4: Capacity acts as a gating condition for coordination.</strong></p>

                    <p>When Capacity constraints are severe (e.g., zero available time, absolute authority prohibition),
                        consistency across all other domains cannot produce behavioral enactment. However, Capacity
                        consistency alone cannot produce sustained practice without support from other domains. This
                        suggests Capacity may function as a necessary-but-not-sufficient condition rather than an
                        additive factor.</p>

                    <p><strong>Proposition 5: Minimum threshold for legitimacy convergence requires consistency in at
                        least four domains, including Norms & Expectations.</strong></p>

                    <p>Based on institutional theory's emphasis on taken-for-grantedness and Gilbert's environmental
                        focus, legitimacy convergence likely requires:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Norms & Expectations consistency (necessary)</li>
                        <li>Plus consistency in at least three additional domains (sufficient when combined with
                            Norms)
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>This proposition is testable through comparative case analysis of practices that achieved
                        legitimacy convergence versus those that stabilized as contested equilibrium.</p>

                    <p><strong>Empirical Validation Requirements</strong></p>

                    <p>These propositions require systematic empirical investigation through:</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Comparative case studies</strong> examining domain consistency patterns in cases of
                            legitimacy convergence vs. contested equilibrium
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Longitudinal process studies</strong> tracking how practices evolve as domain
                            consistency shifts
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Quantitative analysis</strong> coding domain consistency across multiple
                            organizations and measuring time-to-legitimacy-convergence
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Experimental interventions</strong> manipulating specific domains while holding
                            others constant
                        </li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>The six-domain framework provides diagnostic utility even without precise weighting, as
                        contradictions between domains—regardless of relative weight—signal contested legitimacy.
                        However, specifying domain weights and interaction effects would significantly enhance
                        predictive power and intervention targeting.</p>

                    <p><strong>Future Theoretical Development</strong></p>

                    <p>Critical questions requiring further specification include:</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Substitutability:</strong> Can strong consistency in some domains compensate for
                            weak consistency in others? Or are certain domains non-substitutable prerequisites?
                        </li>
                    </ol>

                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Sequencing:</strong> Must domains align in a particular order? Does early
                            consistency in certain domains make later consistency in others easier or harder?
                        </li>
                    </ol>

                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Context dependence:</strong> Do domain weights vary by organizational context (e.g.,
                            highly regulated vs. entrepreneurial), practice type (e.g., technical vs. cultural), or
                            adoption stage (e.g., early vs. late)?
                        </li>
                    </ol>

                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Threshold vs. gradient:</strong> Is legitimacy convergence a discrete threshold
                            (tips when N domains align) or a gradient (gradually strengthens with each additional
                            domain)?
                        </li>
                    </ol>

                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Decay patterns:</strong> When aligned domains fall out of alignment, which losses
                            have the strongest effect on legitimacy dissolution?
                        </li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>These questions represent the theory's current boundaries and opportunities for empirical
                        extension.</p>

                    <h3>Cues</h3>

                    <p><strong>Cues are the observable signals people read from domains to infer legitimacy.</strong>
                    </p>

                    <p>Cues include:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Leadership attention (what leaders spend time on, ask about, ignore)</li>
                        <li>Patterns of reward and punishment (who gets promoted, who gets sidelined)</li>
                        <li>Silence around certain topics (what can't be discussed)</li>
                        <li>Consistency—or inconsistency—between words and actions</li>
                        <li>What gets measured and reviewed</li>
                        <li>Who gets resources and support</li>
                        <li>How mistakes are treated</li>
                        <li>What's celebrated in stories and rituals</li>
                        <li>Time allocation (what people actually have capacity for)</li>
                        <li>Authority boundaries (who can make which decisions)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Cues often operate implicitly.</strong> People may not be able to name them, but they
                        reliably shape behavior by signaling what is safe or dangerous to attempt.</p>

                    <p><strong>The power of cues lies in their consistency across domains.</strong> A single cue might
                        be ambiguous, but when multiple cues across multiple domains consistently point in the same
                        direction, they create coherent signals about legitimacy.</p>

                    <h3>Interpretation and Response</h3>

                    <p><strong>Interpretation</strong> refers to the sensemaking process through which individuals
                        assign meaning to cues.</p>

                    <p><strong>Response</strong> is the action that follows.</p>

                    <p>Importantly, responses are often adaptive rather than intentional. People act in ways that align
                        with what the system appears to reward or tolerate, even when those responses contradict stated
                        values or official policy.</p>

                    <p><strong>This is not deception or bad faith.</strong> It's rational navigation of the cue
                        environment.</p>

                    <p>When someone says "we value innovation" but every cue signals "don't make mistakes," responding
                        with caution is the sensible interpretation of conditions, not resistance to change.</p>

                    <h3>Structures as Pattern Continuously Recreated</h3>

                    <p>In Interpretive Conditions Theory, <strong>structures are not charts, plans, or designs. They are
                        stabilized patterns of response that persist through continuous reenactment.</strong></p>

                    <p>When certain responses repeatedly lead to reward or safety, they become normalized. When
                        responses lead to risk or punishment, they are avoided. Over time, the system "learns" these
                        patterns through distributed individual experience, and future behavior is shaped by this
                        collective learning—even when original conditions have changed.</p>

                    <p>Structures form not only through signals of legitimacy and risk, but also through repeated
                        adaptation to constraint—such as workarounds, delays, or avoidance shaped by tool limits,
                        authority boundaries, or resource restrictions.</p>

                    <p><strong>Structures thus function as organizational memory—but not as information stored
                        somewhere.</strong></p>

                    <p>When we say a structure "remembers," we mean: people have collectively learned, through
                        overlapping experience, what responses are legitimate or viable. This learning guides behavior
                        without requiring constant enforcement.</p>

                    <p><strong>Example: The vacation structure</strong></p>

                    <p>In many workplaces, official policies say employees are encouraged to take time off, or even that
                        vacation is unlimited. Yet people quickly learn how much vacation is actually acceptable by:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Watching who takes time off</li>
                        <li>Observing how it's discussed</li>
                        <li>Noticing whether there are consequences afterward</li>
                        <li>Seeing what happens during busy periods</li>
                        <li>Hearing stories about people who "took too much"</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Over time, employees "just know" how much absence is safe, regardless of what the policy
                        states.</p>

                    <p><strong>This "knowing" only exists because people keep enacting the pattern:</strong></p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>People take "safe" amounts of vacation</li>
                        <li>Managers approve those amounts without comment</li>
                        <li>Taking more triggers subtle or explicit consequences</li>
                        <li>Stories circulate reinforcing the pattern</li>
                        <li>New employees observe and learn the same limits</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>If everyone started taking unlimited vacation tomorrow and nothing bad happened, the structure
                        would dissolve. It persists only through continuous reproduction.</p>

                    <p><strong>Key implication: Structures are fragile in ways we don't typically recognize.</strong>
                    </p>

                    <p>They feel solid and enduring, but they exist only in ongoing enactment. When conditions shift
                        enough that coordinated enactment shifts, even deeply learned structures can change rapidly.</p>

                    <p>Conversely, structures can persist long after formal conditions change, because people continue
                        enacting learned patterns until new coordinated responses emerge.</p>

                    <hr>

                    <h2 id="explaining-stability">Explaining Stability</h2>

                    <p>The theory explains organizational stability as a consequence of learned interpretation, not
                        resistance to change.</p>

                    <p><strong>Patterns persist because people keep finding them sensible, safe, or necessary—not
                        because the patterns are stored somewhere preventing change.</strong></p>

                    <p>Consider a team that once experienced negative consequences for raising concerns. Members
                        learned: "speaking up here is risky." Even after leadership changes, people may remain silent.
                        No one needs to enforce silence; the structure has already formed through distributed learning.
                        The system continues to respond to what it has learned about risk.</p>

                    <p>Each person holds a fragment of this memory:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>"I saw what happened to Jamie when they questioned the approach"</li>
                        <li>"My first week, someone warned me to keep my head down"</li>
                        <li>"In my review, I was told I wasn't a 'team player' after I raised an issue"</li>
                        <li>"Meetings end quickly when no one disagrees"</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>When these fragments overlap enough, they create coordinated enactment: everyone stays silent.
                        The pattern feels real and shared, even though it exists nowhere except in the continuous
                        reproduction of silent responses.</p>

                    <p><strong>This explains why:</strong></p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Change initiatives revert under pressure (old patterns feel safer)</li>
                        <li>Training fails to translate into practice (learned conditions override training)</li>
                        <li>"We tried that once" continues to carry weight (that attempt is part of the memory)</li>
                        <li>New leaders inherit patterns they didn't create (because everyone else still enacts them)
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Stability is not stubbornness; it is memory continuously enacted.</strong></p>

                    <hr>

                    <h2 id="explaining-change">Explaining Change</h2>

                    <p>Change occurs when conditions shift sufficiently that different responses become legitimate—and
                        when enough people begin enacting those different responses that a new coordinated pattern
                        emerges.</p>

                    <p><strong>This may involve:</strong></p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Altering feedback loops (change what gets measured, discussed, rewarded)</li>
                        <li>Redistributing decision authority (change who can make which choices)</li>
                        <li>Changing what is visible or invisible (transparency or opacity around different
                            information)
                        </li>
                        <li>Redefining success and failure (change what counts as "good" performance)</li>
                        <li>Reducing or redistributing risk (make new responses safer through protection, support, or
                            collective action)
                        </li>
                        <li>Aligning cues across domains (ensure all six domains signal the new pattern consistently)
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Creating capacity</strong> (making time available, expanding authority, removing
                            competing demands, addressing structural barriers)
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Critical insight: Change requires both condition shifts AND coordinated enactment of new
                        responses.</strong></p>

                    <p>Changing conditions alone isn't sufficient if people don't enact different responses. And people
                        enacting different responses isn't sustainable if conditions still punish those responses.</p>

                    <p><strong>Change stabilizes when:</strong></p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Conditions shift to make new responses legitimate</li>
                        <li>Enough people enact the new response that it becomes coordinated</li>
                        <li>The new pattern gets repeated enough that it becomes learned</li>
                        <li>Distributed memory now encodes the new pattern as "how we do things"</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p><strong>Interpretive Conditions Theory does not promise predictable outcomes.</strong> People may
                        still respond in unexpected ways. However, it asserts that without meaningful condition change,
                        new behavior often fails to persist—especially once attention, novelty, or pressure fades.</p>

                    <p><strong>Two types of change failure:</strong></p>

                    <p><strong>Type 1: Conditions don't actually change</strong></p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Leaders announce new values but cues across domains still reinforce old patterns</li>
                        <li>Result: Brief compliance followed by reversion</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Type 2: Coordination doesn't emerge</strong></p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Conditions shift but people don't enact new responses at sufficient scale/consistency</li>
                        <li>Result: Scattered adoption, no pattern formation, eventual abandonment</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Successful change requires both.</p>

                    <h2 id="the-coordination-legitimacy-distinction">The Coordination-Legitimacy Distinction</h2>

                    <p>A critical refinement in Interpretive Conditions Theory distinguishes between two types of
                        "tipping points" that are often conflated:</p>

                    <h3>The Coordination Tipping Point (Behavioral Convergence)</h3>

                    <p><strong>People comply because the practice becomes the cheapest way to coordinate:</strong></p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Tools/processes become mandatory to get work done</li>
                        <li>Dependencies assume participation</li>
                        <li>Opt-out becomes costly (friction, delays, exclusion from information/decisions)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>This can happen <strong>without legitimacy.</strong> It's "I do it because I have to" or "because
                        everything else now depends on it."</p>

                    <h3>The Legitimacy Tipping Point (Interpretive Convergence)</h3>

                    <p><strong>People comply because the practice becomes taken-for-granted as
                        sensible/appropriate:</strong></p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>"This is how we do things"</li>
                        <li>Dissent becomes socially weird, not just inconvenient</li>
                        <li>People defend the practice even when it disadvantages them</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>This is what institutional theory often assumes eventually happens through repeated enactment
                        (sedimentation leading to taken-for-grantedness).</p>

                    <h3>The Key ICT Insight: These Can Decouple</h3>

                    <p><strong>Coordination can tip while legitimacy remains contested.</strong></p>

                    <p>This produces <strong>contested equilibrium</strong>—a stable state in which:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Practices are routinely enacted (behavioral stability)</li>
                        <li>But legitimacy never converges (interpretive resistance persists)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>This is not incomplete institutionalization or failed change. It's a predictable
                        attractor when:</strong></p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Enforcement mechanisms sustain behavior (monitoring, dependencies, consequences)</li>
                        <li>BUT the interpretive environment continues generating cues of illegitimacy (unfairness,
                            hypocrisy, misalignment across subunits)
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Open office plans: Widely adopted, persistently hated</li>
                        <li>Performance reviews: Required everywhere, trusted nowhere</li>
                        <li>Return-to-office mandates: Enforced compliance, ongoing legitimacy conflict</li>
                        <li>Compliance training: Everyone does it, no one thinks it works</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>These contemporary examples echo patterns documented in studies of management practice diffusion.
                        Westphal, Gulati, and Shortell (1997) found that organizations widely adopted Total Quality
                        Management to gain institutional legitimacy while varying dramatically in whether they
                        customized practices to address substantive organizational needs, with many implementing TQM
                        symbolically to conform to field-level expectations. The persistence of such patterns across
                        diverse management practices—from TQM in the 1990s to return-to-office mandates today—suggests
                        that contested equilibrium may be a common outcome when practices diffuse through institutional
                        pressures (coercive, mimetic, or normative) rather than through demonstrated local efficacy.</p>

                    <p><strong>Why this matters:</strong></p>

                    <p>Most organizational theory assumes behavioral stability implies legitimacy ("if people keep doing
                        it, they must accept it"). ICT shows this is false.</p>

                    <p>Research on organizational practice adoption provides empirical support for this distinction.
                        Westphal, Gulati, and Shortell (1997) demonstrated that organizations adopt Total Quality
                        Management practices to conform to institutional pressures (achieving behavioral adoption and
                        external legitimacy) while varying widely in whether they customize those practices
                        substantively to fit local technical needs. Early adopters were more likely to customize TQM to
                        address specific organizational problems, while later adopters conformed to gain legitimacy with
                        minimal customization. This pattern—widespread behavioral adoption masking variation in
                        substantive implementation—illustrates how coordination can tip (everyone adopts) while
                        legitimacy remains contested (few internalize). ICT extends this insight by positioning
                        contested equilibrium not as a transitional state on the path to full institutionalization, but
                        as a predictable and potentially durable organizational condition when enforcement mechanisms
                        sustain coordination while cue environments prevent interpretive convergence.</p>

                    <p><strong>Practices can become structurally remembered as routines of compliance before—and even
                        without—becoming legitimate as shared meaning.</strong></p>

                    <p>People learn "this is required" without ever learning "this makes sense." The structure that
                        forms encodes "how to survive this," not "this is right."</p>

                    <p>Research on organizational compliance programs illustrates this dynamic: organizations achieve
                        high behavioral conformity while internal legitimacy remains absent, creating what MacLean and
                        Behnam (2010) term a "legitimacy facade"—external perceptions of legitimacy masking internal
                        illegitimacy and enabling continued dysfunction.</p>

                    <p><strong>Measurement implication:</strong></p>

                    <p>Compliance metrics (adoption rates, usage statistics, behavioral observations) are insufficient
                        evidence of successful change. They measure coordination, not legitimacy.</p>

                    <p>Research on practice diffusion demonstrates why: measuring whether organizations have adopted a
                        practice reveals nothing about whether they have implemented it substantively or adopted it
                        symbolically for legitimacy (Westphal et al., 1997). Organizations widely adopted TQM while
                        varying dramatically in the depth and customization of implementation, with symbolic adopters
                        achieving external legitimacy without internal transformation. Similarly, ICT predicts that high
                        adoption rates can coexist with persistent internal illegitimacy.</p>

                    <p>To assess legitimacy, you need to examine discourse: How do people talk about the practice? Do
                        they justify it or just comply? Do they defend it or work around it? Do they adapt it to local
                        needs or implement it formulaically? The content and depth of adoption matters as much as the
                        fact of adoption.</p>

                    <p><strong>Intervention implication:</strong></p>

                    <p>If you're observing contested equilibrium (high compliance + persistent resistance), adding more
                        enforcement won't resolve legitimacy. You need to address the contradictory cues across domains
                        that prevent interpretive convergence.</p>

                    <h2 id="scope-and-limitations">Scope and Limitations</h2>

                    <p>Interpretive Conditions Theory applies best to persistent patterns of behavior in human systems
                        where interpretation, legitimacy, and learning operate over time.</p>

                    <h3>When ICT Applies</h3>

                    <p><strong>ICT is designed to explain within-organization dynamics:</strong></p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>How patterns form, persist, and change within a single organizational context</li>
                        <li>How legitimacy is learned through interpretation of conditions</li>
                        <li>How distributed memory emerges through coordinated enactment</li>
                        <li>Why behavioral compliance can occur without interpretive convergence</li>
                        <li>How practices can stabilize as contested equilibrium</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>The theory works when:</strong></p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Interpretation is possible</strong> – Actors have cognitive capacity to read cues
                            and assess legitimacy
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Choice exists</strong> – Some meaningful range of response options, even if
                            constrained
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Consequences are observable</strong> – People can learn from what happens when
                            actions are taken
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Coordination matters</strong> – Patterns require some alignment across actors</li>
                        <li><strong>Time for learning</strong> – Repeated interactions allow distributed memory to form
                            through overlapping experience
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>What ICT Does Not Explain</h3>

                    <p><strong>ICT deliberately does not attempt to explain:</strong></p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Field-level diffusion</strong> of practices across organizations (how "best
                            practices" spread industry-wide)
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Industry-wide isomorphism</strong> or convergence (why organizations come to look
                            alike)
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Societal-level institutionalization</strong> (how practices become taken-for-granted
                            across entire societies)
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Purely physical impossibility</strong> or non-negotiable material constraint
                            unrelated to social organization
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Momentary compliance under first-contact coercion</strong> (initial forced behavior
                            before any learning occurs)
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Behavior in total institutions</strong> with continuous surveillance where
                            interpretation becomes irrelevant
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>The psychological origins of radical novelty</strong> or creativity (where entirely
                            new patterns come from)
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Non-social or purely mechanical systems</strong> (machines, algorithms, physical
                            processes)
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>The Relationship Between ICT and Field-Level Institutional Theory</h3>

                    <p>Field-level phenomena—such as industry-wide adoption of practices, regulatory requirements, or
                        professional norms—involve the same interpretive and constraint mechanisms ICT describes, but
                        operating at a different level of analysis.</p>

                    <p><strong>Within organizations,</strong> regulatory requirements, professional norms, and
                        competitor practices function as conditions (constraints and cues) that people interpret and
                        respond to. ICT explains how these external conditions—along with internal ones—shape legitimacy
                        interpretation and coordinated enactment.</p>

                    <p><strong>Across organizations (field-level),</strong> ICT does not explain how these conditions
                        themselves emerge, diffuse, or become widespread. Field-level institutional analysis examines
                        diffusion across organizational fields—"those organizations that, in the aggregate, constitute a
                        recognized area of institutional life" (DiMaggio & Powell, 1983, p. 148)—including industry-wide
                        isomorphism and inter-organizational mimicry. Why do certain regulatory requirements get
                        adopted? How do professional norms form and spread across a profession? Why do industries
                        converge on similar practices? These questions involve field-level dynamics (industry evolution,
                        institutional entrepreneurship, political coalition-building) that ICT treats as background
                        conditions rather than phenomena to be explained.</p>

                    <p><strong>ICT's contribution is explaining what happens inside organizations when these external
                        and internal conditions are present</strong>—how they're interpreted, how responses coordinate
                        into patterns, and why those patterns persist or change through continuous enactment.</p>

                    <p>For example, when a new regulatory requirement is introduced:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Field-level institutional theory explains how that requirement emerged and spread across
                            organizations
                        </li>
                        <li>ICT explains how people within a specific organization interpret that requirement, what
                            legitimacy they assign to compliance, how they coordinate responses, and whether the
                            practice stabilizes as genuinely legitimate or as contested equilibrium
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Both levels of analysis are valuable; ICT is deliberately scoped to the within-organization
                        level.</p>

                    <h3>Boundary Cases Requiring Further Development</h3>

                    <p>Some contexts fall at the boundaries of ICT's scope and require additional theoretical
                        specification:</p>

                    <p><strong>Crisis situations:</strong> Does legitimacy interpretation change under extreme time
                        pressure? Do people revert to deeply learned patterns or break from them? How does interpretive
                        space function when decisions must be immediate?</p>

                    <p><strong>Radical uncertainty:</strong> When cues are completely novel (unprecedented technology,
                        situations with no historical parallel), how does interpretation work without distributed memory
                        to draw upon?</p>

                    <p><strong>Cross-cultural contexts:</strong> Do the six domains operate universally, or are some
                        culture-specific? How does legitimacy interpretation vary across national/cultural boundaries
                        within multinational organizations?</p>

                    <p><strong>Extreme power asymmetries:</strong> At what level of power concentration does
                        interpretation become largely irrelevant? When does coercion fully substitute for
                        legitimacy-based coordination?</p>

                    <p><strong>Hybrid/remote organizations:</strong> How does distributed work (remote, asynchronous)
                        affect cue visibility and distributed memory formation? Does physical co-location matter for
                        pattern coordination?</p>

                    <p>These boundary cases represent opportunities for theoretical extension rather than limitations of
                        the core framework.</p>

                    <h3>What ICT Is and Is Not</h3>

                    <p><strong>ICT is:</strong></p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>A <strong>diagnostic theory</strong> explaining why patterns persist and where influence
                            accumulates
                        </li>
                        <li>A <strong>process theory</strong> focused on continuous enactment rather than static
                            structures
                        </li>
                        <li>A <strong>within-organization theory</strong> deliberately scoped to local coordination
                            dynamics
                        </li>
                        <li>An <strong>interpretive theory</strong> that explains pattern formation through
                            meaning-making
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>ICT is not:</strong></p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>A <strong>predictive theory</strong> that guarantees specific outcomes from interventions
                        </li>
                        <li>A <strong>prescriptive theory</strong> that specifies optimal organizational designs</li>
                        <li>A <strong>comprehensive theory</strong> attempting to explain all organizational phenomena
                        </li>
                        <li>A <strong>deterministic theory</strong> treating behavior as mechanically produced by
                            conditions
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>The theory's value lies not in prediction or prescription, but in making visible the mechanisms
                        through which persistent patterns emerge and are maintained—or how they might be changed—through
                        the ongoing relationship between conditions, interpretation, and coordinated action.</p>

                    <p>Adopts structure-as-process thinking from Structuration Theory (Giddens, 1984) while retaining

                    <h2 id="critiques-and-questions">Critiques and Questions</h2>

                    <p>Critics may argue that Interpretive Conditions Theory under-specifies the mechanics of power,
                        enforcement, and strategic action, particularly in contexts where authority is highly
                        centralized or coercive.</p>

                    <p>Others may question whether the theory can account for moments of rapid change driven by legal
                        rulings, political realignments, or technological disruption.</p>

                    <p><strong>Interpretive Conditions Theory responds that it is not a theory of power acquisition,
                        institutional engineering, or individual motivation.</strong></p>

                    <p>Instead, it explains how legitimacy and constraint shape collective response over time, and how
                        repeated responses stabilize into pattern through continuous coordinated enactment.</p>

                    <p>The theory is most useful for understanding persistence, resistance, backlash, and fragmentation
                        in human systems, and invites empirical testing in contexts where legitimacy and capacity appear
                        misaligned or where structural memory fails to predict behavior.</p>

                    <p><strong>On power:</strong></p>

                    <p>ICT acknowledges that some actors have greater capacity to shape conditions others respond to
                        (what the theory calls "stewardship of conditions"). However, even powerful actors cannot simply
                        impose legitimacy—they can enforce compliance, but interpretive convergence requires cue
                        consistency across domains.</p>

                    <p>Power matters most in determining:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>What gets monitored and enforced (affecting coordination tipping points)</li>
                        <li>What becomes visible or invisible (affecting cue availability)</li>
                        <li>Whose interpretations get amplified or suppressed (affecting coordination around which
                            pattern)
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>But power cannot directly create taken-for-grantedness. That requires coordinated enactment and
                        distributed learning over time.</p>

                    <hr>

                    <h2 id="why-this-theory-matters">Why This Theory Matters</h2>

                    <p>Interpretive Conditions Theory offers a way to understand organizing by explaining how people in
                        systems respond to the conditions around them, independent of intent or plan.</p>

                    <p>It integrates communication theory, institutional theory, and process thinking to show how
                        legitimacy and constraint shape collective response over time, and how those responses stabilize
                        into pattern through continuous coordinated enactment.</p>

                    <p>Rather than asking leaders to control behavior or change mindsets, the theory reframes the
                        problem. It asks a simpler, harder question:</p>

                    <blockquote><p><strong>What is this system teaching people to do—and what is it making possible or
                        impossible?</strong></p></blockquote>

                    <p>That question—more than any directive—explains why patterns persist, why change efforts stall or
                        backfire, and how organizing unfolds over time.</p>

                    <p><strong>For practitioners:</strong></p>

                    <p>ICT provides a diagnostic framework for understanding why change isn't happening:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Are conditions actually different, or just the words?</li>
                        <li>Do cues across all six domains align, or are they contradictory?</li>
                        <li>Has coordination tipped but legitimacy remained contested?</li>
                        <li>Are people learning "how to survive this" rather than "this makes sense"?</li>
                        <li>Is the real barrier capacity (time, authority, competing demands)?</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>For researchers:</strong></p>

                    <p>ICT offers testable propositions about when legitimacy converges versus remains contested, when
                        behavioral stability indicates taken-for-grantedness versus contested equilibrium, and how
                        distributed learning through coordinated enactment produces structural persistence.</p>

                    <h2 id="contributions">Contributions</h2>

                    <p>Interpretive Conditions Theory contributes a legitimacy-centered, processual account of
                        persistence in human systems by foregrounding how stabilized patterns of response function as
                        organizational memory formed through continuous coordinated enactment in response to interpreted
                        conditions.</p>

                    <p>This framing helps explain why patterns stabilize, resist change, and recur over time—even after
                        leadership changes, new strategies, or shifts in intent.</p>

                    <p><strong>Key theoretical contributions:</strong></p>

                    <p><strong>1. Distinguishes coordination from legitimacy</strong></p>

                    <p>Shows that behavioral stability can occur without interpretive convergence, producing contested
                        equilibrium as a stable organizational state.</p>

                    <p><strong>2. Specifies structure as continuous enactment</strong></p>

                    <p>Treats structures not as entities that persist independently, but as patterns that exist only
                        through ongoing reproduction by distributed actors with overlapping learned responses.</p>

                    <p><strong>3. Integrates and operationalizes the legitimacy-interpretation-memory loop</strong></p>

                    <p>While institutional theory foregrounds legitimacy in organizational conformity (Meyer & Rowan,
                        1977; DiMaggio & Powell, 1983), practice diffusion research demonstrates that behavioral
                        adoption can occur without substantive implementation (Westphal et al., 1997), structuration
                        theory conceptualizes memory traces, interpretive schemas, and legitimation as interconnected
                        dimensions of structure (Giddens, 1984), sensemaking emphasizes interpretation and retrospection
                        (Weick, 1995), and performance engineering identifies environmental support systems as primary
                        drivers of behavior (Gilbert, 1978), ICT integrates these mechanisms and operationalizes how
                        they function recursively at the micro level by specifying: (1) how legitimacy is signaled
                        through consistent cues across environmental domains (adapting Gilbert's framework), (2) how
                        interpretation occurs through reading these cue patterns, and (3) how distributed memory forms
                        through overlapping learned responses. This integration explains not only why practices are
                        adopted (institutional pressures) but how they persist—or fail to persist—through continuous
                        within-organization enactment.</p>

                    <p><strong>4. Explains non-deterministic persistence</strong></p>

                    <p>Shows how patterns can persist through agency rather than despite it—people keep choosing
                        responses that recreate the pattern because conditions make those responses sensible.</p>

                    <p><strong>5. Positions contested equilibrium as predictable, not pathological</strong></p>

                    <p>Challenges the assumption that organizational patterns must eventually become taken-for-granted.
                        Institutional theory's dominant process model treats institutionalization as progression through
                        habituation, objectification, and sedimentation, where full institutionalization requires
                        practices to become taken-for-granted (Tolbert & Zucker, 1996). Practices that persist without
                        achieving this final stage are framed as semi-institutionalized—incomplete rather than stable.
                        ICT demonstrates when and why legitimacy remains durably contested even as behavioral compliance
                        stabilizes.</p>

                    <p><strong>6. Specifies how structural domains shape patterns through three mechanisms</strong></p>

                    <p>Extends Gilbert's (1978) environmental focus by showing that structural domains don't just
                        enable/constrain action and signal priorities—they also shape cognition by providing the
                        interpretive frames, language, and mental models through which people understand situations and
                        imagine possibilities. This triple mechanism explains why structural changes are so powerful and
                        why contradictory domains create cognitive dissonance beyond simple mixed signals.</p>

                    <p>By explicitly linking legitimacy, interpretation, agency, and constraint in a recursive model of
                        persistence through coordinated enactment, the theory clarifies how everyday responses
                        accumulate into durable patterns without requiring continuous enforcement or assuming
                        individual-level bad faith.</p>

                    <p>It offers a non-deterministic account of leadership responsibility oriented toward shaping
                        conditions that influence what actions become legitimate and sustainable in lived practice.</p>

                    <p><strong>Its primary contribution is integrating mechanisms identified separately across
                        institutional theory, structuration theory, sensemaking, and performance engineering into a
                        coherent, operationalizable framework for understanding within-organization persistence through
                        continuous enactment.</strong></p>

                    <p>An organization wants teams to experiment more. Leaders announce the change, provide training,
                        and emphasize innovation. Yet behavior does not shift.</p>

                    <p>From an Interpretive Conditions perspective, audit cues across the six domains:</p>

                    <p><strong>Data & Feedback:</strong> What gets measured and reviewed?</p>

                    <ul>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Do approval processes require extensive justification before trying anything?</li>
                        <li>Are tools optimized for efficiency (making experimentation costly) or iteration (making it

                        </li>
                        <li>Are there protected resources (time, budget, space) for experiments?</li>
                        <li>Do tools provide language for "experiments" or only "deliverables"?</li>

                        <li>Are people already at 100% utilization on existing priorities?</li>
                        <li>Can people say "no" to existing work to make room for experiments?</li>
                        <li>Do competing demands from other initiatives consume available time?</li>
                        <li>Are people authorized to redirect resources toward experiments?</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Skills & Knowledge:</strong> Can people actually do this?</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Have people been trained in rapid prototyping, hypothesis testing, learning from failure?
                        </li>
                        <li>Are there accessible examples and templates?</li>
                        <li>Can people observe successful experimentation by others?</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Motivation & Values:</strong> Is this connected to what matters?</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Do promotions go to people who executed flawlessly or those who learned through
                            experimentation?
                        </li>
                        <li>Are bonuses tied to meeting targets (discouraging risk) or generating insights?</li>
                        <li>Do leaders visibly protect and reward people who experiment?</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Norms & Expectations:</strong> What actually happens when people try something new?</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Are experiments celebrated or scrutinized?</li>
                        <li>Are "failures" treated as learning or career-limiting?</li>

                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>If the consistency pattern across domains says:</strong></p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Leaders SAY "innovate" (words in Norms domain)</li>
                        <li>Tools make it costly and use delivery-focused language (friction in Tools domain, cognitive
                            mismatch)
                        </li>
                        <li>Metrics punish variation (Data domain signals efficiency focus)</li>
                        <li>Mistakes are discussed publicly (Norms domain signals risk)</li>
                        <li>Promotions go to flawless executors (Motivation domain misalignment)</li>
                        <li><strong>AND people are already working 50-hour weeks with no slack capacity</strong>
                            (Capacity domain signals impossibility)
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Then the system is teaching:</strong> "Innovation is espoused, but structurally
                        impossible to enact and cognitively difficult to envision."</p>

                    <p><strong>The capacity constraint alone can prevent change even if all other domains
                        align.</strong> If people genuinely want to innovate (Motivation ✓), know how (Skills ✓), have
                        tools (Processes ✓), and see it's measured (Data ✓), but simply don't have time or authority,
                        innovation won't happen.</p>

                    <p>The structure that forms is risk-avoidance, regardless of what leaders say they want. People
                        respond to the consistency pattern across domains, not the words.</p>

                    <p><strong>For change to occur:</strong></p>

                    <p>Conditions across domains must shift to make experimentation legitimate:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Protect early experimenters from negative consequences</li>
                        <li>Create tools/processes that make trying things easy and use appropriate language
                            ("hypotheses," "experiments," "learning")
                        </li>
                        <li>Measure and celebrate learning, not just success</li>
                        <li>Train people in experimentation methods</li>
                        <li>Connect experimentation to advancement and rewards</li>
                        <li><strong>Create actual capacity</strong> by removing competing priorities, creating protected
                            time, or expanding authority boundaries
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>When cues align consistently across domains, legitimacy can converge. When enough people enact
                        the new response (experimenting), and it gets repeated enough that distributed learning occurs
                        ("experimenting here is safe and rewarded"), the structure shifts.</p>

                    <p><strong>The pattern persists only through continuous reenactment.</strong> If conditions revert,
                        the pattern will too.</p>

                    <h3>When Encouragement Isn't Enough</h3>

                    <p>Organizations often encourage behaviors they genuinely want to see—speaking up, taking
                        initiative, experimenting, or collaborating across boundaries. Leaders may communicate these
                        intentions clearly and repeatedly. Yet the behavior often fails to appear, or appears briefly
                        and then fades.</p>

                    <p>Interpretive Conditions Theory explains why encouragement alone is rarely sufficient.</p>

                    <p><strong>Consider a team where leaders regularly say, "If you see a problem, raise it."</strong>
                    </p>

                    <p>On the surface, this message signals openness. However, over time, other conditions may tell a
                        different story:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>When concerns are raised, meetings run long and other priorities get delayed</li>
                        <li>The person who spoke up is subtly labeled as "difficult" or "not a team player"</li>
                        <li>Issues raised are acknowledged but rarely result in visible action</li>
                        <li>Leaders become defensive or ask for extensive documentation before considering the concern
                        </li>
                        <li>People who stay quiet and execute are praised for being "low-maintenance"</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>No one explicitly discourages speaking up, but the system's responses create cues about
                        risk and legitimacy.</strong></p>

                    <p>Eventually, team members stop raising concerns—not because they disagree with the message, but
                        because they have learned what the system actually rewards. Silence becomes the sensible
                        response.</p>

                    <p><strong>Each person learns through their own experience and observation:</strong></p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>"I raised that process issue and nothing changed except people seemed annoyed"</li>
                        <li>"Jamie questioned the timeline and got a reputation for being negative"</li>
                        <li>"In my review I was told to focus on solutions not problems"</li>
                        <li>"The people who get promoted never rock the boat"</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>When these distributed individual learnings overlap enough, coordinated pattern emerges: everyone
                        stays silent. The structure exists not in any policy or chart, but in the continuous enactment
                        of silent responses.</p>

                    <p><strong>Importantly, this pattern often persists even after leadership changes or new messaging
                        is introduced. The structure has already formed through distributed learning.</strong></p>

                    <p>New leaders arrive and say "we really do want to hear concerns!" But people have learned
                        otherwise through experience. Until conditions across domains actually shift—until speaking up
                        is protected, rewarded, connected to advancement, and results in visible action—the pattern
                        persists.</p>

                    <p><strong>Interpretive Conditions Theory highlights that people are not responding to what leaders
                        say they want; they are responding to what the system has taught them through consistent cues
                        across multiple domains.</strong></p>

                    <p>In this way, persistent silence reflects organizational memory continuously enacted, not
                        individual attitude or courage.</p>

                    <p><strong>This example illustrates a core insight of the theory:</strong></p>

                    <p>Behavior that appears resistant or irrational is often a rational response to the interpretive
                        conditions people face. To change behavior sustainably, leaders must look beyond messages and
                        intentions and examine the conditions—across all six domains—that continue to shape
                        interpretation through consistent cues.</p>

                        <dd>The capacity of people to choose how they respond to conditions, even when options are
                            constrained. Agency is how structures are recreated or changed—every response is enactment
                            that either reproduces or shifts the pattern.
                        </dd>
                        <dt><strong>Domains of Influence</strong></dt>
                        <dd>Six analytically distinct categories of environmental and social cues through which
                            legitimacy is signaled and learned: (1) Data & Feedback, (2) Tools & Processes, (3)
                            Capacity, (4) Skills & Knowledge, (5) Motivation & Values (all structural/environmental),
                            and (6) Norms & Expectations (collective/social). Adapted from Gilbert's (1978) Behavior
                            Engineering Model with the addition of Norms & Expectations as the collective interpretive
                            layer. People interpret legitimacy by reading signals across all domains simultaneously.
                        </dd>
                        <dt><strong>Cues</strong></dt>
                        <dd>Observable signals drawn from conditions that indicate what actions are legitimate, risky,
                            or worthwhile. Cues operate through cross-domain consistency—when multiple cues across
                            multiple domains consistently point in the same direction, they create coherent signals
                            about legitimacy.
                        </dd>
                        <dt><strong>Interpretation</strong></dt>
                        <dd>The sensemaking process through which individuals assess cues and determine what actions
                            make sense within the system.
                        </dd>
                        <dt><strong>Response</strong></dt>
                        <dd>The actions people take—or avoid—based on their interpretation of legitimacy and risk.
                            Responses can reproduce existing patterns, vary slightly, violate and test patterns, or
                            (when coordinated) create new patterns.
                        </dd>
                        <dt><strong>Structures</strong></dt>
                        <dd>Patterns continuously recreated through coordinated action. Structures exist as distributed
                            memory (what people have collectively learned through overlapping experience) and persist
                            only through ongoing reenactment. Not objects or stored information, but observable
                            regularity in coordinated responses.
                        </dd>
                        <dt><strong>Distributed Memory</strong></dt>
                        <dd>What people have collectively learned, through overlapping experiences, about what responses
                            are legitimate, safe, or worthwhile. No single person holds "the structure"—everyone holds
                            fragments, and overlap creates apparent coherence and enables coordination.
                        </dd>
                        <dt><strong>Coordination Tipping Point</strong></dt>
                        <dd>The threshold at which a practice becomes the easiest way to coordinate work, regardless of
                            whether it's considered legitimate. Occurs through network effects, tool dependencies, and
                            process integration.
                        </dd>
                        <dt><strong>Legitimacy Tipping Point</strong></dt>
                        <dd>The threshold at which a practice becomes taken-for-granted as sensible/appropriate. People
                            defend it even when it disadvantages them. Dissent becomes socially weird, not just
                            inconvenient.
                        </dd>
                        <dt><strong>Contested Equilibrium</strong></dt>
                        <dd>A stable state in which practices are routinely enacted (coordination has tipped) but
                            legitimacy remains persistently contested. Behavioral stability without interpretive
                            convergence. Not failed institutionalization but a predictable attractor when enforcement
                            sustains behavior while cue environments remain contradictory.
                        </dd>
                        <dt><strong>Change</strong></dt>
                        <dd>A shift in the conditions people respond to—particularly legitimacy cues across
                            domains—combined with coordinated enactment of new responses that, through repetition,
                            create new distributed memory. Not a declaration of goals, attitudes, or desired end states.
