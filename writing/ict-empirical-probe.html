                    <p>
                        This study tests three Interpretive Conditions Theory (ICT) hypotheses about how discourse changes across the lifecycle of a return-to-office (RTO) mandate.
                        Using only publicly available Reddit submissions and a preregistered dictionary approach, the analysis tracks three constructs across four policy phases:
                        <strong>(H1)</strong> legitimacy conflict persists beyond announcement,
                        <strong>(H2)</strong> structural memory framing appears primarily after the policy becomes lived and consequential, and
                        <strong>(H3)</strong> exit/decoupling framing emerges primarily during stabilization rather than during announcement or early enforcement.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the observed analytic subset (<span class="mono">N = 24</span> RTO-relevant posts), legitimacy framing appears in multiple phases (T1–T3),
                        memory framing appears only in stabilization (T3),
                        and exit/decoupling framing appears only in stabilization (T3).
                        Given small window sizes and coarse measurement, results are treated as evidence about temporal ordering rather than population estimates.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These results support a temporal extension of ICT (“temporal lock”), in which
                        legitimacy functions as a persistent background filter, while structural memory
                        appears as a delayed, reactive interpretive resource that becomes salient only
                        after constraint is lived rather than anticipated.
                    </p>


                    <h2 id="intro" class="major">1. Introduction</h2>
                    <p>
                        Mandates often produce immediate disagreement but delayed interpretive resolution. ICT predicts that different interpretive resources become salient under different conditions:
                        anticipated constraint (announcement), lived constraint (enforcement), and routine constraint (stabilization).
                        This paper tests whether public discourse traces exhibit “phase-locked” emergence consistent with that claim.
                    </p>

                    <h2 id="background" class="major">Background</h2>
                    <p>
                        Starbucks’ RTO changes provide a strong case for ICT because they introduce contradictory cues: a formal rule shift (more in-office time) alongside discourse about leadership expectations, cultural reset, and relocation requirements. Public reporting describes a move to four in-office days beginning around the start of the next fiscal year (late September / October 2025), plus relocation expectations for people leaders within a specified time horizon, with a voluntary exit offer for those unwilling to comply.
                    </p>
                    <p class="small">
                        Policy background sources include Starbucks’ public message and major press coverage summarizing implementation timing and scope.
                    </p>

                    <h2 id="theory" class="major">2. Theory</h2>
                    <p>
                        Interpretive Conditions Theory (ICT) explains how patterns persist because people respond to conditions that shape what feels sensible, appropriate, or viable.
                        This study focuses on three constructs:
                        <strong>Legitimacy</strong> (appropriateness/fairness/credibility conflict),
                        <strong>Structural Memory</strong> (explicit comparison to prior stabilized arrangements, e.g., “this worked during COVID”),
                        and <strong>Exit/Decoupling</strong> (withdrawal or “compliance theater” framing).
                    </p>

                    <h2 id="hypotheses" class="major">3. Hypotheses</h2>

                    <h3>H1 — Legitimacy persists beyond announcement</h3>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Prediction:</strong> legitimacy-conflict framing appears during announcement and persists into later phases rather than being confined to an initial spike.
                        <br /><strong>Falsification:</strong> legitimacy framing is absent (or near-zero) outside the announcement window.
                    </p>

                    <h3>H2 — Structural memory is reactive</h3>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Prediction:</strong> memory framing appears primarily during stabilization.
                        <br /><strong>Falsification:</strong> memory framing appears similarly during announcement/enforcement as during stabilization.
                    </p>

                    <h3>H3 — Exit/decoupling framing is late interpretive resolution</h3>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Prediction:</strong> exit/decoupling framing appears primarily during stabilization (and not before memory appears).
                        <br /><strong>Falsification:</strong> exit/decoupling framing appears prior to memory framing or uniformly across phases.
                    </p>

                            <strong>H1</strong> predicts legitimacy persists beyond announcement; legitimacy appears across T1–T3 (Table 2).
                            <strong>H2</strong> predicts memory is phase-locked to stabilization; memory remains absent until T3.
                            <strong>H3</strong> predicts exit/decoupling framing appears late; it remains absent until T3 and co-occurs with memory onset.
                            Dot size encodes prevalence (Table 2).
                            <br />
                            The phase-locked onsets shown here support a temporal lock interpretation:
                            legitimacy operates as a persistent evaluative background (H1), while structural
                            memory emerges reactively under stabilized constraint (H2), with exit framing
                            appearing after both conditions are present (H3).

                    <h2 id="discussion" class="major">6. Discussion</h2>
                    <p>
                        The pattern supports the ICT claim under test: legitimacy conflict appears early and persists, while structural memory and exit/decoupling framing appear only once the mandate becomes routine.
                        The key result is the <em>ordering</em>, not the magnitude.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Exit/decoupling” here is explicitly a discursive construct: it includes both literal exit language (“forcing me out”) and compliance-theater language (“look busy,” “compliance”).
                        This prevents overstating behavioral attrition while still testing the theoretical prediction about late-stage interpretive resolution.
                    </p>

                    <h3 id="temporal-lock">Theoretical Contribution: The Temporal Lock</h3>

                    <p>
                        Most organizational change research implicitly assumes a linear impact model:
                        instruction &rarr; interpretation &rarr; response. The pattern observed in this
                        study is inconsistent with that assumption. Instead, interpretive resources
                        appear to be <em>phase-locked</em>: some are immediately available, while others
                        become salient after conditions are lived and consequential.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This finding advances Interpretive Conditions Theory (ICT) from a static
                        diagnostic lens to a <em>temporal theory of interpretation</em>. In this dataset,
                        legitimacy framing behaves as a persistent background condition&mdash;a stable
                        filter through which actors evaluate authority, intent, and appropriateness
                        across all phases. By contrast, structural memory framing behaves as a reactive
                        resource, becoming available after enforcement stabilizes and constraint
                        is experienced in daily work.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The distinction is theoretically consequential. Legitimacy appears to orient
                        actors toward the future (“Should this be happening?”), while memory functions
                        as a tool for surviving the present (“We already proved another way works, so
                        why absorb this cost now?”). Under ICT, this pattern is expected: organizational
                        structures do not simply persist as inert history, but re-emerge selectively
                        when new conditions collide with what the system has learned to treat as viable.

                    <p>
                        Using only public discourse traces and a fully reproducible pipeline, this study finds a phase-locked ordering consistent with ICT:
                        legitimacy persists; memory and exit/decoupling appear only during stabilization. The value of the result is the temporal pattern.
