                                    As a consultant, I work with many internal change agents . Matthew is unique. He was hired as an expert in Agile development to create the durable practices and culture that scale as the company grows. What distinguishes him is the sway he has with influential senior engineers and management. His secret is that he listens deeply, really deeply, finding a way to get real commitment to a business aligned strategy and move forward. I would work with Matthew again in a heartbeat. He brings his best to work every day.

                                <h3>What others have to say:</h3>
                                <blockquote>
                                    Matthew was tireless in his effort to move Ticketfly's engineering methods and processes forward. His deep knowledge of agile methodologies and his experience in technical practices as a former developer made it a joy to work with Matthew. On several occasions, he organized training sessions by well-known industry experts. Matthew is cheerful, always optimistic, and has a good sense of humor. I am looking forward to working with Matthew again in the future, not just because he is great at what he does, but also because he genuinely cares.

                                </blockquote>
                                <blockquote>
                                    Matthew is a great coach! He works with developers to improve individual and team performance. He collaborates with senior management to build autonomous teams. I highly recommend him and would love to work with him again!
                                    Matthew never holds back on sharing his knowledge. He works with engineers to help them either adapt to Agile principles or reinforce their practice on continuous improvement. He organized and ran code dojo sessions when the team needed to pick up a new programming language.
                                    As a manager, my first interaction with Matthew was in a meeting he helped facilitate. The encounter and impact were detailed in my post <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-15-peers-make-decision-less-than-hour-mu-qiao">https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-15-peers-make-decision-less-than-hour-mu-qiao</a>. Working with Matthew, I've learned a new set of tools and framework to help me function more effectively as a leader.
